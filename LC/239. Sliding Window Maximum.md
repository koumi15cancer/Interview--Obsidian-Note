Approach 1: Brute Force

Pseudo code:
- Slide the window from the start to the end of the array.
- For each window, calculate and find max value by iterate through k elements
- TC O(n*k)
- SC O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        result = []
        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            result.append(max(nums[i:i+k]))
        return result

```

Approach 2: Deque ( Double end queue)

Pseudo code:
- Iterate through array while maintaining deque
- For each elements, remove elements from back of the deque if they <= new elements ( can not be maximum)
- Remove elements from front if out of bound of the current window
- Element at the front of deque is maximum of current window
- TC O(N)
- SP @

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        deq = deque()
        result = []
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # Remove elements not within the sliding window
            if deq and deq[0] < i - k + 1:
                deq.popleft()
            
            # Remove elements that are smaller than the current element
            while deq and nums[deq[-1]] < nums[i]:
                deq.pop()
            
            # Add the current element at the end of deque
            deq.append(i)
            
            # The first element of deque is the largest element for the current window
            if i >= k - 1:
                result.append(nums[deq[0]])
        
        return result
