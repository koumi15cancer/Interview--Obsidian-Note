Are you currently in Singapore?
- I've already returned back to Saigon
What is your strengthes and weaknesses as a developer?
- My technical strength is focused on backend development and data processing, scripting automation for deployment and integration. 
  In terms of soft skill, self-learning to adopt new technology for industry is my strength
- I believe my weakness is relevant to time management since sometime I don't estimate and manage task well but I can still finish the task by its priority
Do you have any experiences in web development?
- Yes I have experience working for web development mostly involved with industry backend development: NodeJS Express, Java Spring boot.
   For the frontend, I also have experience but not in-depth implementation, mostly fundamental web form layout.
