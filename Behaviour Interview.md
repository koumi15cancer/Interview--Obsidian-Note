**Tell me about a time when you wanted to change something that was outside of your regular scope of work.**

Situation: In my previous role as a Software Engineer at Mizuho Information & Research Institute Asia Pte. Ltd, I was primarily responsible for developing frontend features and assisting with the migration of legacy code. However, during a team meeting, I noticed that there was a recurring issue with the manual process of database query optimization. Despite not being directly responsible for backend development, I recognized an opportunity to improve efficiency and reduce response times by automating this process.

Task: I decided to take initiative and propose a solution to automate the database query optimization process. This task was outside of my regular scope of work as a frontend developer, but I believed it aligned with our team's goal of improving overall system performance and productivity. I knew that by implementing automation, we could free up valuable time and resources for other critical tasks.

Action: I conducted research on best practices for database query optimization and explored potential automation tools and techniques. Drawing on my knowledge of scripting languages and automation frameworks, I developed a prototype for automating database query optimization using Python scripts and shell commands. I presented my proposal to the team and obtained buy-in from stakeholders, highlighting the potential benefits and cost savings associated with automation.

Result: The automation solution I developed significantly reduced the time and effort required for database query optimization. By automating repetitive tasks such as query tuning and index optimization, we were able to improve backend response times by 30% and enhance overall system performance. The success of this initiative not only demonstrated my ability to proactively identify and address inefficiencies but also showcased my willingness to go above and beyond my regular responsibilities to drive positive change within the team.

Overall, this experience taught me the importance of seizing opportunities to make meaningful contributions, even if they fall outside of my designated role. It reinforced the value of collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement in achieving organizational goals.

**What was the last project you led, and what was its outcome?**

Situation: During my time as a Junior Software Engineer at Mizuho Information & Research Institute Asia Pte. Ltd, I had the opportunity to contribute to a project focused on improving the frontend of a financial application. As a junior team member, I was tasked with leading the development of several key features as part of this project.

Task: My main responsibility was to oversee the implementation of new frontend functionalities, assist in the migration of legacy code to newer frameworks, and contribute to setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Although these tasks were outside my usual scope of work as a junior engineer, I was eager to take on the challenge and learn new skills.

Action: To begin, I collaborated closely with senior team members to understand the requirements and priorities for each feature. I then took the initiative to research and learn about the technologies and tools required for the project, including ReactJS, NodeJS, and TypeScript.

I actively participated in the design and development process for the new frontend features, working closely with senior developers to translate design specifications into code. I took on smaller tasks within each feature, such as implementing UI components or writing unit tests, under the guidance of senior team members.

In addition, I assisted in the migration of legacy code by following detailed instructions provided by senior developers. I contributed to updating dependencies, refactoring code, and conducting basic testing to ensure compatibility and stability.

Furthermore, I supported the setup of CI/CD pipelines by helping with basic configurations and assisting in running automated tests. I learned how to use tools like Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD under the guidance of senior team members, gaining valuable hands-on experience in DevOps practices.

Result: As a junior team member, my contributions to the project were instrumental in achieving its goals. Although I faced challenges and had a steep learning curve, I embraced the opportunity to expand my skills and knowledge. By successfully leading several features and actively participating in the project, I demonstrated my ability to adapt, learn quickly, and contribute effectively to the team's success.
