	- High Performance
	- Reliable
	- REST API
	- Blob Container ( As Folder ) in Storage Browser
	- Flat Structure ( Doesn't exist, just UI )
- File Service
	-  File Share
	- Replace File Servers
	- LIFT & SHIFT
	- File SYNC
- Queue Service ( Equivalent to SQS)
	- Store Messages
	- Decouple
	- Basic FIFO
	- More Advanced then go to Service Bus
- Table Service ( Equivalent to DynamoDB AWS)
