## Introduction
- Focuses on automating data ingestion and transformation steps to reduce manual work.
- Uses Azure Databricks' Autoloader feature for automation.

## Typical BI Workflow
- **Source Data**: Various types of source data including CSV, JSON, XML files, and data from databases like SQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and APIs.
- **Ingesting Data**: Use services like Azure Data Factory to ingest data into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- **Data Organization**: Organize data into layers to avoid data swamps and ensure data quality.

## Data Layers
1. **Raw Layer**: Stores data in native formats (e.g., CSV).
2. **Confirmed Layer**: Data converted to Delta format for better analytics performance.

## Using Autoloader
- **Purpose**: Automate the process of converting raw data to Delta format and saving it in the data lake.
- **Integration**: Can be integrated with Azure Data Factory for continuous data processing.

## Configuration and Setup
1. **Setup Directory**: Create directories for raw data and processed data.
2. **Simulate Data Upload**: Upload data manually or through automated processes to the raw data directory.

## Implementing Autoloader
- **Define Paths**: Set paths for input (raw data), output (Delta format data), and checkpoint (progress tracking).
- **Streaming**: Autoloader uses streaming under the hood to process new files continuously.

## Handling Schema Changes
- **Schema Inference**: Autoloader can infer the schema automatically.
- **Schema Evolution**: Autoloader supports schema evolution, allowing new columns to be added without breaking the process.
- **Rescue Mode**: Unrecognized columns are stored in a special "rescue data" column for later processing.

## Advanced Features
1. **Schema Hints**: Provide hints to Autoloader for specific columns.
2. **Error Handling**: Manage errors due to schema changes or data type mismatches.
3. **Trigger Modes**: Set Autoloader to run continuously or on-demand to save resources.

## Event-Driven Processing
- **Event Grid**: Use Azure Event Grid to trigger Autoloader based on events like file creation.
- **Queue-Based Processing**: Use Azure Storage Queues to manage and process file creation events efficiently.

## Summary
- Automating data processing with Autoloader reduces manual intervention and ensures consistent data quality.
- Autoloader is flexible and supports various configurations to handle different data processing needs.
