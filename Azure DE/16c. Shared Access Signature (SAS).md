### Summary of the Video: Using Shared Access Signatures (SAS) Tokens in Azure Data Lake Storage


![[Using Shared Access Signatures (SAS) Tokens in Azure Data Lake Storage.png]]

#### Introduction
The video continues the discussion on methods to connect to Azure Data Lake Storage without using identity-based access. The focus is on Shared Access Signatures (SAS) tokens, which provide more granular access control compared to access keys.

#### Key Concepts
1. **Types of SAS Tokens**:
   - **Account Level SAS**: Provides access to multiple services within a storage account with configurable permissions and time ranges.
   - **Service Level SAS**: Grants access to specific services, such as Blob or File services, and allows permissions down to the individual file level.
   - **User Delegated SAS**: Similar to service level SAS but does not require access keys, instead using user permissions to create the token.

2. **Account Level SAS**:
   - Allows selection of services (Blob, File, Queue, Table) and specific resource types (service, container, object).
   - Configurable permissions (read, write, delete, list).
   - Set start and end dates for token validity.
   - Restrict access to specific IP addresses.
   - Requires access keys for signing, making it less secure if access keys are compromised.

3. **Service Level SAS**:
   - Scoped to a single service.
   - Provides granular access to specific files or blobs.
   - Configurable using similar options as account level SAS but more specific to the service.
   - Can invalidate tokens by rotating the access key used to sign them or using stored access policies to control access.

4. **User Delegated SAS**:
   - Does not require access keys, using user permissions to generate the token.
   - Only applicable to Blob service, including Data Lake.
   - Effective permissions are the intersection of the user's permissions and those set in the SAS token.
   - Can invalidate by disabling user permissions or invalidating the user delegation key through an API call.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Creating Account Level SAS**:
   - Navigate to the Azure portal, select the storage account, and generate the SAS token.
   - Configure services, resource types, permissions, time range, and IP restrictions.
   - Use the generated SAS URL in applications to access the storage account.

2. **Creating Service Level SAS**:
   - Select the specific file or blob in the storage account.
   - Generate the SAS token with required permissions and validity period.
   - Use the SAS URL to access the specific file or blob.

3. **Creating User Delegated SAS**:
   - Generate the token by changing the signing method to user delegation.
   - Set permissions and time range.
   - Use the token with the effective permissions derived from both the user and the token settings.

4. **Storing and Using SAS Tokens**:
   - Store SAS tokens securely, preferably in Azure Key Vault.
   - Use the tokens in applications to access Azure Data Lake Storage securely.

#### Conclusion
SAS tokens provide a more secure and granular way to control access to Azure Data Lake Storage compared to access keys. While account and service level SAS tokens require access keys, user delegated SAS tokens eliminate this requirement by leveraging user permissions. Properly managing these tokens, including storing them securely and using policies for fine-grained control, enhances data security.
