Summary



The video script discusses common file types (CSV, XML, JSON) in data engineering, highlighting their structures, use cases, and considerations for working with them.

Highlights
- CSV files are simple text files with comma-separated values, commonly used in data engineering. 📁
- XML files support hierarchical data structures and can be validated against schemas for data integrity. 🌲
- JSON files are lightweight, easy to read, and widely used in APIs for data exchange. 📄
Key Insights
- CSV files are straightforward but lack schema enforcement, requiring careful attention to metadata for data integrity and proper parsing. 🧐
- XML files excel in handling hierarchical data structures and support schemas for data validation, ensuring data integrity and consistency. 🌟
- JSON files offer a more concise and readable format compared to XML, making them a preferred choice for data exchange in APIs. 🚀


CSV:
 - Text Files
 - Can be opened by any tool
 - Simple
 - No Schema Enforcement
 - Ask for metadata
	 -  Date Format
	 - Time zone
	 - Number Format
	 - Max Length
	 - Scale Decision
	 - Column Delimiter
	 - Text Qualifier
	 - Escape Character ( Most common one is \\)
	 - Encoding Type (ref: [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!) – Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/))

XML:
	- Hierarchy
	- Easy to understand
	- Support Data Types & Schemas
	- Lengthy
	- Well Formed XML vs Valid XML

JSON:
	- Hierarchy
	- Easy to Understand
	- Used by APIs
