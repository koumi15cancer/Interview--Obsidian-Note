1. **Portfolio Management Service <-> Real-Time Data Integration Service**:
    
    - The Portfolio Management Service requires real-time updates on cryptocurrency prices from the Real-Time Data Integration Service.
    - Using gRPC for communication between these services enables bidirectional streaming, allowing the Portfolio Management Service to subscribe to price updates and receive them in real-time.
    - This ensures that the portfolio is always up-to-date with the latest market data, enabling timely decision-making for investment strategies.
2. **Portfolio Management Service <-> Machine Learning Model Integration Service**:
    
    - The Portfolio Management Service needs to interact with the Machine Learning Model Integration Service to obtain personalized investment recommendations based on historical data and user preferences.
    - Leveraging gRPC allows for efficient communication between these services, enabling the Portfolio Management Service to send portfolio data and receive strategy suggestions in real-time.
    - Bidirectional streaming capabilities in gRPC can facilitate continuous updates and adjustments to the investment strategy based on evolving market conditions.
3. **Gateway Service <-> Internal Microservices**:
    
    - The Gateway Service serves as the entry point for external clients and forwards requests to internal microservices for processing.
    - Internally, the Gateway Service interacts with various microservices such as the User Service, Authentication Service, and Portfolio Management Service.
    - Adopting gRPC for communication between the Gateway Service and internal microservices can enhance performance and reduce latency, especially for high-throughput scenarios where efficient communication is essential.
4. **Real-Time Data Integration Service <-> External Data Sources (e.g., Binance, OKX)**:
    
    - The Real-Time Data Integration Service needs to establish persistent connections with external data sources to receive real-time updates on cryptocurrency prices.
    - Using gRPC to communicate with external data sources can provide performance benefits, as it allows for bidirectional streaming of data updates.
    - This enables the Real-Time Data Integration Service to efficiently consume real-time data streams from external sources, ensuring timely and accurate updates for portfolio management.
