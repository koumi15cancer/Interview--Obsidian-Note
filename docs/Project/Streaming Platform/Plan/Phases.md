### Phase 1: Data Generation and Ingestion
**Weeks 1-2**
**Scope:**
- Research and select tools and libraries for generating synthetic music stream event data.
- Develop scripts or applications to generate diverse and realistic music stream event data resembling Spotify usage patterns.
- Set up Kafka as the streaming data source and configure topics and partitions to handle high-throughput data ingestion.
- Implement Kafka producers to emit synthetic event data to Kafka topics.

### Phase 2: Data Processing and Storage
**Weeks 3-4**
**Scope:**
- Utilize Apache Spark for real-time stream processing of music stream event data ingested from Kafka.
- Apply transformations, aggregations, and analyses to enrich and analyze the streaming data.
- Perform data cleansing, normalization, and validation to ensure data quality and consistency.
- Choose and set up a scalable and reliable object storage solution such as Google Cloud Storage or Minio for storing raw and processed music stream data.

### Phase 3: Orchestration and Transformation
**Weeks 5-6**
**Scope:**
- Configure Apache Airflow as the orchestrator to automate and schedule the entire data pipeline.
- Define Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Airflow to orchestrate data ingestion, processing, and storage tasks.
- Monitor pipeline execution, handle dependencies, and retry failed tasks for fault tolerance and reliability.
- Use dbt (data build tool) to transform raw streaming data into structured, queryable datasets.
- Define dbt models to apply business logic, aggregations, and calculations to the streaming data.

### Phase 4: Dashboard Creation
**Weeks 7-8**
**Scope:**
- Develop interactive dashboards using the Streamlit framework for data visualization and exploration.
- Design intuitive user interfaces to navigate and analyze music stream analytics.
- Incorporate visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables to present key insights from the data.
- Enable users to explore trends, patterns, and correlations in their streaming behavior.

### Key Deliverables:
- Synthetic music stream event data generator
- Kafka setup and configuration for data ingestion
- Apache Spark data processing pipeline
- Object storage setup for raw and processed data storage
- Apache Airflow orchestration and automation setup
- dbt transformation models and jobs
- Streamlit dashboard for music stream analytics
