- Consider using the two-pointer technique for questions that involve searching for a pair (or more) of items in an array that meet a certain criteria.

_Examples:_

- Finding a pair of items that sum to a given target in an array.
    
- Finding a triplet of items that sum to 0 in a given array.
    
- Finding the maximum amount of water that can be held between two array items representing wall heights.

# Eliminating Pairs
# Pointers as Region

```python

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def twoPointerMethod(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Sort the array (if necessary, based on the problem)
        nums.sort()
        
        # Step 2: Initialize two pointers
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        # Step 3: Iterate while left pointer is less than right pointer
        while left < right:
            current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]  # Example operation
            
            # Step 4: Check the condition
            if current_sum == target:
                return [nums[left], nums[right]]  # Return the pair
            elif current_sum < target:
                left += 1  # Move left pointer to the right to increase the sum
            else:
                right -= 1  # Move right pointer to the left to decrease the sum
        
        # Step 5: If no pair found, return an indication (optional based on the problem)
        return []

# Example usage:
# solution = Solution()
# result = solution.twoPointerMethod([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)
# print(result)  # Output: [1, 5] or [2, 4] based on the sorted order
