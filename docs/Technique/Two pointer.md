# Eliminating Pairs
- Consider using the two-pointer technique for questions that involve searching for a pair (or more) of items in an array that meet a certain criteria.

_Examples:_

- Finding a pair of items that sum to a given target in an array.
    
- Finding a triplet of items that sum to 0 in a given array.
    
- Finding the maximum amount of water that can be held between two array items representing wall heights.
