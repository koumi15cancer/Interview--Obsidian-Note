## **ðŸ”¹ Project 1: Automated Incident Response Bot**

### **ðŸ›  Features**
- Monitor system health using **Prometheus API**
- Trigger auto-recovery actions (restart services, scale up instances)
- Send alerts to **Slack/PagerDuty/Discord**
- Log incident history for analysis
- Provide a **dashboard or CLI tool** to visualize incidents
- Define customizable **incident response playbooks**
- Implement **machine learning-based anomaly detection** to predict failures

### **ðŸ’¡ Tech Stack**
- **Golang** (for concurrency & API calls)
- **Prometheus API** (to fetch system metrics)
- **Slack API / PagerDuty API** (for notifications)
- **PostgreSQL or Redis** (to store incident logs)
- **Grafana** (for dashboard visualization)
- **Kubernetes & Docker** (for deployment)
- **Terraform** (for infrastructure automation)

### **ðŸ“Œ Implementation Steps**
1. **Set up monitoring**: Integrate Prometheus with application services
2. **Define alerting rules**: Configure Prometheus Alertmanager to trigger incidents
3. **Develop auto-recovery actions**: Implement scripts to restart services or scale instances
4. **Integrate notifications**: Use Slack/PagerDuty API to alert on-call engineers
5. **Store & analyze incidents**: Log incident history in PostgreSQL/Redis for trend analysis
6. **Create dashboards**: Use Grafana to display incident trends and system health
7. **Enhance with ML**: Implement machine learning models to predict future failures
8. **Deploy & automate**: Use Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform for deployment and automation

### **ðŸš€ Next Steps**
- Fine-tune auto-recovery mechanisms
- Implement real-time log aggregation
- Expand integrations with more cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Add role-based access control (RBAC) for security
