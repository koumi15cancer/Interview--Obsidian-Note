## Introduction
- Azure Databricks is commonly used for data transformation.
- DBT (Data Build Tool) enhances the transformation process by providing additional capabilities.

## Typical BI Workflow
- **Data Sources**: Files (CSV, JSON, XML), databases, APIs.
- **Data Ingestion**: Using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to load data into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2).
- **Data Layers**:
  - **Raw Layer**: Stores data in native formats.
  - **Delta Layer**: Converts data to Delta format for better performance.

## Using DBT for Data Transformation
- **Purpose**: Transform data already present in the data warehouse.
- **Integration**: Works on top of Databricks to automate and enhance data transformation.

## Configuration and Setup
1. **Create Directories**: Set up directories for raw data and processed data.
2. **Simulate Data Upload**: Upload data manually or through automated processes to the raw data directory.

## Implementing DBT
- **Define Paths**: Set paths for input (raw data), output (transformed data), and checkpoints.
- **Staging Layer**: Perform lightweight operations like renaming or removing columns.
- **Models Layer**: Apply business logic and create dimensions and facts following the star schema.

## DBT Features
- **Lineage and Dependency Graphs**: Automatically generate lineage graphs to visualize data flow.
- **Testing**: Embed tests to verify data quality, such as uniqueness and not-null constraints.
- **Documentation**: Generate and maintain up-to-date documentation directly from the code.

## Execution and Deployment
- **Commands**: Use DBT commands like `dbt run` and `dbt test` to execute transformations and tests.
- **Automation**: Automate the deployment and execution of transformations using DBT commands.

## Advanced Configuration
1. **Macros**: Define reusable SQL snippets to simplify query writing.
2. **Incremental Loads**: Configure models for incremental loads to handle large datasets efficiently.
3. **Jinja Templating**: Use Jinja to create dynamic and reusable SQL statements.

## DBT Licensing
- **DBT Core**: Free command-line tool.
- **DBT Cloud**: Offers a web-based UI with various licensing options (Developer, Team).

## Summary
- **Enhanced Transformation**: DBT adds significant value to Databricks by automating documentation, testing, and lineage tracking.
- **Flexibility**: DBT works with multiple data platforms, not just Databricks.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies data transformation processes and enhances productivity.
