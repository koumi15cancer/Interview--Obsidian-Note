### Detailed Summary of Azure Stream Analytics Window Functions with Examples

Azure Stream Analytics window functions are used to perform time-based operations on streaming data. Here are the main types with examples:

1. **Tumbling Window**: Non-overlapping, fixed-size time intervals.
   - Example: Calculate the sum of sales every 10 seconds.
   - **Use Case**: Counting the number of sales transactions every 10 seconds.
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) 
     FROM input TIMESTAMP BY time 
     GROUP BY TumblingWindow(second, 10)
     ```

2. **Hopping Window**: Overlapping windows of fixed size.
   - Example: Count events in 10-second windows that hop every 5 seconds.
   - **Use Case**: Monitoring the number of events in overlapping intervals to detect trends.
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) 
     FROM input TIMESTAMP BY time 
     GROUP BY HoppingWindow(second, 10, 5)
     ```

3. **Sliding Window**: Outputs events when they occur within the window.
   - Example: Calculate the average temperature every minute with a sliding window.
   - **Use Case**: Calculating the average temperature every minute to provide real-time updates.
     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(temperature) 
     FROM input TIMESTAMP BY time 
     GROUP BY SlidingWindow(minute, 1)
     ```

4. **Session Window**: Groups events arriving close together.
   - Example: Sum of page views in sessions separated by 5 minutes of inactivity.
   - **Use Case**: Summing page views in sessions that are separated by 5 minutes of inactivity.
     ```sql
     SELECT SUM(pageviews) 
     FROM input TIMESTAMP BY time 
     GROUP BY SessionWindow(minute, 5)
     ```

5. **Snapshot Window**: Groups events with the same timestamp.
   - Example: Calculate total sales at each timestamp.
   - **Use Case**: Calculating total sales at specific timestamps for precise point-in-time reporting.
     ```sql
     SELECT SUM(sales) 
     FROM input TIMESTAMP BY time 
     GROUP BY SnapshotWindow()
     ```

These functions allow for powerful temporal data analysis in real-time streaming scenarios.
