## Introduction
This article explains how to transform raw data into a structured dimensional model using Azure Databricks, a versatile data and analytics platform.

## What is Azure Databricks?
Azure Databricks is an integrated data and analytics platform that facilitates a range of data processing and analytics tasks, including:

1. **Building Enterprise Data Lakehouse:** Integrates data lakes and data warehouses.
2. **ETL and Data Engineering:** Extract, Transform, Load processes.
3. **Machine Learning and Data Science:** Supports AI and data science workflows.
4. **Data Warehousing and BI:** Facilitates data warehousing and business intelligence.
5. **Data Governance and Sharing:** Manages data governance and sharing.
6. **Streaming Analytics:** Handles real-time data streams.

## Positioning Databricks in a BI Solution
Databricks is used for the transformation phase in a BI solution:

1. **Data Sources:** Files, databases, APIs, etc.
2. **Data Lake:** Store raw data in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).
3. **Transformation:** Use Databricks to clean and transform the data.
4. **Storage:** Save the cleaned data back to the data lake or other storage systems.

## Databricks Architecture
Databricks utilizes a distributed architecture based on Apache Spark:

1. **Driver Node:** The brain that manages tasks.
2. **Worker Nodes:** Perform the actual data processing tasks.

## Provisioning Databricks in Azure
Steps to set up Azure Databricks:

1. **Create Workspace:** An instance of Databricks in the Azure portal.
2. **Launch Workspace:** Access the Databricks user interface.
3. **Create Cluster:** Configure a cluster for computation.

## Cluster Configuration
Important settings for configuring a Databricks cluster:

1. **Cluster Mode:** Single node (for individual use) or multi-node (for team use).
2. **Cluster Access Mode:** Single user, shared, or no isolation.
3. **Databricks Runtime Version:** Choose a version with long-term support.
4. **Auto Termination:** Set a timeout for the cluster to terminate when not in use.
5. **Spot Instances:** Option to use cheaper, preemptible VMs with the risk of eviction during high demand.

## Using Databricks for Transformation
A simple transformation scenario:



1. **Connect to Data Lake:** Use an access key (for simplicity, though not recommended for production).
2. **Read Data:** Load raw data from the data lake.
3. **Display Data:** Visualize the data in a tabular format.
4. **Write Data:** Save the transformed data back to the data lake in Delta format.

## Practical Example
The example demonstrates reading raw JSON data from ADLS, displaying it, and saving it back as Delta format for improved efficiency and compression.

## Conclusion
Azure Databricks is a powerful platform for data transformation, offering a range of features to handle various data processing needs. This overview and simple practical example provide a starting point for using Databricks effectively.
