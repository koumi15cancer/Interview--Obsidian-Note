### Summary of the Video: Executing ADF Pipelines

![[Executing ADF Pipelines.png]]

#### Introduction
The video discusses various methods for executing Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines, including debugging, triggering, and scheduling. It also covers different trigger types and their use cases.

#### Key Concepts
1. **Execution Modes**:
   - **Debug Mode**: Used for testing pipelines locally before deployment. It executes the version of the pipeline loaded in the web browser.
   - **Trigger Mode**: Executes the deployed version of the pipeline in ADF.

2. **Git Integration**:
   - **Without Git Integration**: Changes are deployed using the "Publish" button. All required properties must be set, and collaboration is limited.
   - **With Git Integration**: Changes are committed to a code repository (e.g., Azure DevOps), allowing for versioning, collaboration, and CI/CD pipelines.

3. **Trigger Types**:
   - **Trigger Now**: Executes the pipeline on demand.
   - **Schedule Trigger**: Executes pipelines based on a defined schedule (e.g., every day at 1 AM).
   - **Tumbling Window Trigger**: Splits the timeline into equal intervals (e.g., every hour) and allows backfilling for past data.
   - **Storage Event Trigger**: Executes pipelines in response to blob events (e.g., file upload) in a storage account.
   - **Custom Event Trigger**: Uses Event Grid to execute pipelines in response to custom events generated by other systems.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Debug Mode**:
   - Create a new pipeline in the web browser.
   - Use the "Debug" option to test the pipeline locally.

2. **Trigger Mode**:
   - **Without Git Integration**:
     - Create and configure the pipeline.
     - Use the "Publish" button to deploy changes.
     - Use "Add Trigger" to schedule or execute the pipeline.
   - **With Git Integration**:
     - Commit changes to the code repository.
     - Use CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.

3. **Setting Up Triggers**:
   - **Schedule Trigger**:
     - Create a new trigger with a defined schedule (e.g., daily at 1 AM).
     - Deploy the trigger.
   - **Tumbling Window Trigger**:
     - Create a new trigger with a defined interval (e.g., every hour).
     - Configure additional properties like delay and max concurrency.
     - Use parameters like window start and end to process data within specific intervals.
   - **Storage Event Trigger**:
     - Create a new pipeline with parameters to capture file names.
     - Create a trigger for blob events in a specified storage account and container.
     - Deploy the trigger and upload a file to test.
   - **Custom Event Trigger**:
     - Create a trigger for custom events using Event Grid.
     - Configure the event producer and consumer settings.

#### Conclusion
ADF offers flexible execution options for pipelines, including debug mode for local testing and trigger mode for scheduled or event-driven execution. Using Git integration enhances collaboration and CI/CD capabilities. Different trigger types cater to various scheduling and event-driven scenarios, providing robust solutions for data ingestion and processing.
