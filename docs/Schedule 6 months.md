  - Project Coding (1.5 hours)
  - System Design (0.5 hours)
  - LeetCode (1 hour)
- **Day 6**:
  - System Design Review (1 hour)
  - Computer Science Fundamentals (2 hours)
- **Day 7**:
  - Behavioural Questions (3 hours)

## Month 3-4: Shift to LeetCode
### Daily Schedule
- **1.5 hours**: LeetCode
- **0.5 hours**: Computer Science Fundamentals (Overlap with LeetCode)
- **1 hour**: Project Coding

### Weekly Structure
- **Day 1-5**:
  - LeetCode (1.5 hours)
  - Computer Science Fundamentals (0.5 hours)
  - Project Coding (1 hour)
- **Day 6**:
  - Computer Science Fundamentals Deep Dive (3 hours)
- **Day 7**:
  - Review Behavioral Questions and System Design (3 hours)

## Month 5-6: System Design & Behavioral Questions
### Daily Schedule
- **1.5 hours**: System Design
- **1.5 hours**: Behavioral Questions

### Weekly Structure
- **Day 1-5**:
  - System Design (1.5 hours)
  - Behavioral Questions (1.5 hours)
- **Day 6**:
  - Integration of all skills (3 hours, Review Project Coding, LeetCode, Computer Science Fundamentals)
- **Day 7**:
  - Mock interviews combining Behavioral Questions and System Design (3 hours)

## Key Tips for Success
- **Integration**: Constantly integrate what you learn in one area with others. For example, use LeetCode problems to test concepts from Computer Science Fundamentals, or apply System Design principles in your coding projects.
- **Flexibility**: Adjust the daily schedule as you progress. If you find youâ€™re ahead in one area, reallocate time to another.
- **Regular Review**: Use the 6th and 7th days of each week to review, reflect, and consolidate learning.
