# Approach 1:

1. **Stack**: This algorithm uses a stack to keep track of numbers. The `*` and `/` operations are computed immediately, while the `+` and `-` operations are deferred until the end.
    
2. **Current Number**: `current_number` accumulates digits as they're read.
    
3. **Operator Handling**: The `operator` variable stores the last operator encountered. Depending on the operator:
    
    - `+`: Push `current_number` to the stack.
    - `-`: Push `-current_number` to the stack.
    - `*`: Pop the last value from the stack, multiply it by `current_number`, and push the result back onto the stack.
    - `/`: Pop the last value from the stack, divide it by `current_number`, and push the truncated result back.
4. **Truncation**: The division (`/`) uses `int()` to truncate the result towards zero, as required by the problem.
    
5. **Final Sum**: At the end, we sum all the values in the stack, which handles all the `+` and `-` operations.

```python

class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        
        current_number = 0
        stack = []
        operator = '+'
        
        # Iterate through the string
        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            if char.isdigit():
                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
            
            # If it's an operator or end of the string
            if char in "+-*/" or i == len(s) - 1:
                if operator == '+':
                    stack.append(current_number)
                elif operator == '-':
                    stack.append(-current_number)
                elif operator == '*':
                    stack.append(stack.pop() * current_number)
                elif operator == '/':
                    stack.append(int(stack.pop() / current_number))  # Python truncates towards 0 automatically
                    
                # Update for the next number and operator
                operator = char
                current_number = 0
        
        # Return the sum of all values in the stack
        return sum(stack)


```


# Approach 2:

The solution starts by initializing `result` to 0, which will store the final result of the calculation. `number` is an empty string used to build up the current number being processed, and `aux_num` is also an empty string used to store intermediate results for multiplication and division. The method then processes each character in the string, appending a `+` at the end to ensure that the final number is included in the calculations.

**Addition and Subtraction:** Both of these operators work directly with the current total result. When the method encounters a `+`, it adds the current number to `result`. Similarly, when it encounters a `-`, it subtracts the current number from `result`. After performing these operations, it updates the result with this result and clears the current number to prepare for the next one.

**Multiplication and Division:** These operators involve intermediate calculations. For multiplication (`*`), the method multiplies the current number by a previously stored number and updates the stored number with this result, so future calculations use the new value. Similarly, for division (`/`), the method divides a previously stored number by the current number and updates the stored number with this result, so future calculations use the new value. This approach ensures that multiplication and division are handled correctly before addition and subtraction.

``` python

class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:

        result = 0        # Holds the final result of the expression
        number = ''       # Accumulates digits to form the current number
        aux_num = ''      # Stores intermediate results for multiplication and division
        prev_op = '+'     # Keeps track of the previous operator, initialized to '+'

        # Process each character in the string, with an extra '+' to ensure the last number is processed
        for char in s + '+':
            if char.isdigit():
                number += char  # Build the current number from consecutive digits
            
            elif char == ' ':
                continue  # Ignore spaces

            elif char in '-+':
                # Update result based on the previous operator
                match prev_op:
                    case '+':
                        result += int(number)  # Add the current number to result
                        number = ''
                    case '-':
                        result -= int(number)  # Subtract the current number from result
                        number = ''
                    case '*':
                        result += int(number) * int(aux_num)  # Multiply with stored value and add to result
                        number, aux_num = '', ''
                    case '/':
                        result += int(int(aux_num) / int(number))  # Divide stored value by the current number and add to result
                        number, aux_num = '', ''

                prev_op = char  # Update previous operator to the current one

            elif char in '*/':
                # Update auxiliary number based on the previous operator
                match prev_op:
                    case '*':
                        aux_num = int(number) * int(aux_num)  # Multiply current number with the stored value
                        number = '' 
                    case '/':
                        aux_num = int(int(aux_num) / int(number))  # Divide stored value by current number
                        number = ''
                    case '+':
                        aux_num = number  # Set aux_num to the current number for future multiplication/division
                        number = ''
                    case '-':
                        aux_num = '-' + number  # Set aux_num to the negative of the current number
                        number = ''
                
                prev_op = char  # Update previous operator to the current one

        return result  # Return the final result of the evaluated expression
