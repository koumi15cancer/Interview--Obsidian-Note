# Approach 1:


1. **`validate(node, low, high)`**: A helper function that takes three parameters:
    
    - `node`: The current node being checked.
    - `low`: The lower bound for the node's value (initially `-inf` for the root).
    - `high`: The upper bound for the node's value (initially `inf` for the root).
2. **Base Case**: If the node is `None` (meaning we’ve reached a leaf node), return `True`, as an empty subtree is valid.
    
3. **Condition**: The current node's value must satisfy the condition `low < node.val < high`. If this condition fails, return `False`.
    
4. **Recursion**:
    
    - For the left subtree, we update the `high` bound to the current node’s value (`node.val`).
    - For the right subtree, we update the `low` bound to the current node’s value (`node.val`).
5. **Initial Call**: The `validate` function is called with the root node, and the initial bounds set to negative and positive infinity to allow any value.
    

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Every node is visited once.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. For a balanced tree, it will be O(log n), and for a skewed tree, it will be O(n).

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        
        # Helper function to recursively validate the BST
        def validate(node, low, high):
            # Base case: An empty node is valid
            if not node:
                return True
            
            # Current node must be within the range [low, high]
            if not (low < node.val < high):
                return False
            
            # Recursively validate the left and right subtrees
            return (validate(node.left, low, node.val) and
                    validate(node.right, node.val, high))
        
        # Initialize with the full range of valid integer values
        return validate(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))



```


# Approach 2: In-order Traversal

1. **In-order Traversal**:
    - The helper function `inorder(node)` performs an in-order traversal of the tree (left subtree → current node → right subtree).
2. **`self.prev`**:
    - This variable keeps track of the value of the previously visited node. It is initialized as `None` before starting the traversal.
3. **Checking BST Validity**:
    - During the traversal, if the current node’s value is less than or equal to `self.prev`, it means the tree is not a valid BST, and we return `False`.
4. **Base Case**:
    - If the `node` is `None` (empty), it is a valid subtree, so we return `True`.
5. **Return Value**:
    - The result of the entire traversal will tell us whether the tree is a valid BST.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Every node is visited once during the in-order traversal.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), this could be O(n). In a balanced tree, it will be O(log n).

    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        self.prev = None
        
        # Helper function to perform in-order traversal
        def inorder(node):
            if not node:
                return True
            
            # Traverse the left subtree
            if not inorder(node.left):
                return False
            
            # Check the current node with the previous node
            if self.prev is not None and node.val <= self.prev:
                return False
            
            # Update the previous node to the current one
            self.prev = node.val
            
            # Traverse the right subtree
            return inorder(node.right)
        
        # Start the in-order traversal
        return inorder(root)
