- **is_valid Function**:
    
    - **Row Check**: Ensure the number doesn’t already exist in the current row.
    - **Column Check**: Ensure the number doesn’t already exist in the current column.
    - **Subgrid Check**: Ensure the number doesn’t already exist in the 3x3 subgrid containing the cell.
- **backtrack Function**:
    
    - **Find Empty Cell**: Search for the first empty cell (represented by '.').
    - **Try Numbers**: Attempt to place each number (1 through 9) in the empty cell.
    - **Recursive Call**: After placing a number, recursively call `backtrack` to continue solving.
    - **Backtrack**: If placing a number leads to no solution, revert the change (remove the number) and try the next option.
    - **Base Case**: If all cells are filled correctly, return `True`.
- **Solve Sudoku**:
    
    - **Start Backtracking**: Begin the solving process with the `backtrack` function.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of solving a Sudoku puzzle with backtracking can be quite high, especially for complex puzzles. In the worst case, it can be exponential due to the large number of potential configurations to explore, although most practical cases are solved efficiently.
    
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is primarily due to the recursion stack used in backtracking, which is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the size of the board (in this case, `n = 9` for a 9x9 Sudoku). Additional space is used for storing the board.
    

This implementation ensures that the board is solved in place, adhering to the constraints of not returning anything but modifying the input board directly.
