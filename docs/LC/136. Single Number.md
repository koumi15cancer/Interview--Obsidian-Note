Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

# Approach 1:

The most efficient approach to solve this problem is using the **XOR bitwise operation**. The properties of XOR make it particularly suitable for this problem:

### Approach

- **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` which contains the method `singleNumber`.
    
- **Method Definition**:
    
    - The method `singleNumber` takes a list of integers `nums` as input.
    - It initializes a variable `result` to zero.
- **Iteration**:
    
    - We iterate through each `number` in the `nums` list.
    - We update `result` using the XOR operation with the current `number`.
- **Return Value**:
    
    - After processing all numbers, `result` will hold the single number that does not have a duplicate. We return this value.
### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)O(n)O(n) - We need to iterate through the entire array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)O(1)O(1) - We use a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.


```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        for number in nums:
            result ^= number  # Use XOR to find the single number
        return result



```
