# Approach 1: BFS

- **Initial Setup**:
    
    - You determine the number of rows and columns in the image using `rows = len(image)` and `cols = len(image[0])`.
    - You also store the starting color of the pixel located at `(sr, sc)` in `markColor = image[sr][sc]`.
- **Edge Case Handling**:
    
    - If the starting pixel's color (`markColor`) is already the target `color`, no BFS is needed, and the image can be returned immediately.
- **BFS Queue Initialization**:
    
    - You initialize a queue `q` using a deque (double-ended queue), starting with the pixel `(sr, sc)`. The deque will hold pixels that need to be processed.
    - `q = deque([(sr, sc)])` adds the initial pixel to the queue.
- **BFS Loop**:
    
    - The main part of BFS is the loop that processes the queue:
        - `q.popleft()` removes the pixel from the front of the queue, simulating a breadth-first traversal.
        - For the current pixel `(r, c)`, if the pixel is within bounds and its color matches `markColor` (the original color before filling), you change the pixel's color to the target color: `image[r][c] = color`.
        - After filling the current pixel, you add its neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right) to the queue using `q.extend([(r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)])`. These are the pixels that will be processed next.
- **Termination**:
    
    - The loop continues until all reachable pixels with the same original color are processed and the queue becomes empty. At that point, the image is returned with the flooded color.

```python

class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        rows = len(image)
        cols = len(image[0])
        markColor = image[sr][sc]
        
        if markColor == color:  # If the starting pixel already has the target color, no need for BFS
            return image
        
        q = deque([(sr,sc)])
        while q:
            r,c = q.popleft()
            if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and image[r][c] == markColor:
                image[r][c] = color
                q.extend([(r-1,c),(r+1,c),(r,c-1),(r,c+1)])
                
        return image
        
```


# Approach 2: DFS

- **Stack-based Traversal**: The algorithm uses an explicit stack (`stack = [(sr, sc)]`) to explore the image. Using a stack is characteristic of DFS, as it explores as far as possible in one direction before backtracking.
    
- **Processing the Current Pixel**:
    
    - You pop the current pixel coordinates `(x, y)` from the stack and mark it as visited.
    - If the pixel has already been visited, it skips further processing for that pixel.
    - If not, it changes the pixel's color to the desired new color (`image[x][y] = color`).
- **Exploring Neighboring Pixels**:
    
    - For each pixel `(x, y)`, the algorithm examines its four neighbors (up, down, left, right) using the `movement` list.
    - If a neighboring pixel is within bounds and has the same original color (`image[newX][newY] == based`), it is added to the stack for further exploration.
    - The algorithm keeps going deeper into each branch before backtracking, which is how DFS works.

```python
class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        visited = set()
        rows, cols = len(image) , len(image[0])
        movement = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]
        based = image[sr][sc]
        stack = [(sr,sc)]
        while stack:
            x, y = stack.pop()
            if (x,y)  in visited:
                continue
            visited.add((x,y))
            image[x][y] = color
            for corX, corY in movement:
                newX, newY = x + corX, y + corY
                if 0 <= newX < rows and 0 <= newY < cols and image[newX][newY] == based:
                    stack.append((newX, newY))
        return image
            
        

```
