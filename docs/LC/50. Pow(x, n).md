- **Base Case**:
    
    - The function first checks if `n` is `0`. According to the mathematical rule, any number raised to the power of `0` is `1`. So, it returns `1`.
- **Negative Exponent Handling**:
    
    - If `n` is negative, it converts `x` to its reciprocal (`1 / x`) and makes `n` positive. This handles the case where we want to calculate x−nx^{-n}x−n.
- **Iterative Calculation**:
    
    - The function initializes a variable `result` to `1`. This variable will store the final result.
    - It uses a `while` loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than `0`.
- **Exponentiation by Squaring**:
    
    - Inside the loop:
        - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), it multiplies `result` by `x`. This step ensures that if there's an odd factor in the exponent, it's included in the result.
        - Then, it squares `x` (`x *= x`) to account for the power of two. This is a key part of the "exponentiation by squaring" technique, which reduces the number of multiplications needed.
        - It divides `n` by `2` (`n //= 2`) to effectively halve the exponent, continuing the process until `n` is reduced to `0`.
- **Return Result**:
    
    - Finally, it returns the accumulated `result`, which is the value of xnx^nxn.


```python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        if n < 0:
            x = 1 / x
            n = -n
        result = 1
        while n > 0:
            if n % 2 == 1:
                result *= x
            x *= x
            n //= 2
        return result


```

### Dry Run Example

Let’s do a dry run of the function with an example, say x=2.0x = 2.0x=2.0 and n=10n = 10n=10.

1. **Initial Values**:
    
    - `x = 2.0`
    - `n = 10`
    - `result = 1`
2. **First Iteration**:
    
    - `n = 10` (even): `result = 1`
    - `x = 2.0 * 2.0 = 4.0`
    - `n = 10 // 2 = 5`
3. **Second Iteration**:
    
    - `n = 5` (odd): `result = 1 * 4.0 = 4.0`
    - `x = 4.0 * 4.0 = 16.0`
    - `n = 5 // 2 = 2`
4. **Third Iteration**:
    
    - `n = 2` (even): `result = 4.0`
    - `x = 16.0 * 16.0 = 256.0`
    - `n = 2 // 2 = 1`
5. **Fourth Iteration**:
    
    - `n = 1` (odd): `result = 4.0 * 256.0 = 1024.0`
    - `x = 256.0 * 256.0 = 65536.0`
    - `n = 1 // 2 = 0`
6. **Exit Loop**:
    
    - `n` is now `0`, so we exit the loop.
7. **Return Value**:
    
    - The function returns `result = 1024.0`.


# Approach 2:


## Explanation of the Code

### Main Function (`myPow`):

- This function checks if the exponent \( n \) is non-negative.
- If \( n \) is non-negative, it calls the helper function `helper(x, n)`.
- If \( n \) is negative, it calls `helper(x, -n)` to calculate the positive exponent and returns its reciprocal, \( \frac{1}{\text{result}} \).

### Helper Function (`helper`):

- The base case checks if \( n \) is \( 0 \). If so, it returns \( 1 \) because \( x^0 = 1 \).
- It then recursively calls `myPow` with \( n // 2 \). This step significantly reduces the number of calls, as \( n \) is halved in each call.
- Depending on whether \( n \) is even or odd, it computes the final result:
  - If \( n \) is even, it returns \( \text{temp} \times \text{temp} \).
  - If \( n \) is odd, it returns \( \text{temp} \times \text{temp} \times x \).

### Why This Avoids Maximum Recursion Depth

#### Halving the Problem:

- The key to why this implementation can avoid hitting the recursion limit lies in how the exponent \( n \) is reduced. Each time the helper function is called, \( n \) is halved. This means the number of recursive calls grows logarithmically relative to the size of \( n \) (specifically \( O(\log n) \)), rather than linearly \( O(n) \).
- For example, for \( n = 10 \):
  - `helper(x, 10)` calls `helper(x, 5)`.
  - `helper(x, 5)` calls `helper(x, 2)`.
  - `helper(x, 2)` calls `helper(x, 1)`.
  - `helper(x, 1)` calls `helper(x, 0)`, which hits the base case.

#### Stack Depth:

- With this approach, even for large \( n \), the depth of the call stack remains manageable (e.g., about 30 recursive calls for \( n = 1,073,741,824 \) due to \( \log_2(1,073,741,824) = 30 \)).
- This is much smaller than if you had a linear recursive approach where each level of recursion would correspond to one decrement of \( n \).

#### Efficient Use of Recursion:

- The recursive function uses the results of previous calls to compute the final result, leveraging the properties of exponentiation. This efficient calculation means that even though it uses recursion, it does so in a way that avoids the recursion depth issue typical of more straightforward recursive implementations.


```python
# First part
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        if n >= 0:
            return self.helper(x, n) #1
        else:
            return 1/self.helper(x, -n) #2
    
    
# Second part
    
    def helper(self, x, n): 
        if n == 0: #3
            return 1
        
        temp = self.myPow(x, n//2) #4
         
        if int(n%2) == 0: #5
            return  temp * temp
        else:
            return temp * temp * x
