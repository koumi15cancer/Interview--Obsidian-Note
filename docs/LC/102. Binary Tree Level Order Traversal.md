# Approach 1: Backtracking Approach DFS

### Key Points:

- **Backtracking**: As you traverse the tree, you're "backtracking" after each left or right child visit and ensuring that nodes are stored at their respective levels.
- **Result Storage by Level**: You store the nodes level-wise using `result[level]`, ensuring that nodes of the same depth are grouped together.

### When to use Backtracking:

- **Backtracking**: Works well for recursive problems like DFS when you want to make decisions based on previous state, especially when building something like a path.
- **Storing Level Index**: More explicit and gives a clear understanding of which nodes belong to which level. It can sometimes be easier to debug, as you control level-wise insertion.
```python

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        def dfs(node,level):
            if not node:
                return 

            if len(result) == level:
                result.append([])

            result[level].append(node.val)

            dfs(node.left, level + 1)
            dfs(node.right, level + 1)
        
        dfs(root, 0)
        return result


```


# Approach 2: BFS Using a Queue

### BFS Using a Queue

The BFS approach uses a queue to store nodes at each level and processes them in a first-in-first-out manner. This ensures that nodes are processed level by level, and for each level, we can store the nodes in a list.

### BFS Approach:

1. **Initialize a queue** with the root node.
2. **Process each level**: For each node in the current level, add its value to the result list and enqueue its children for the next level.
3. **Repeat until the queue is empty**, meaning all levels have been processed.



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []
        
        result = []
        queue = deque([root])  # Initialize the queue with the root node
        
        while queue:
            level_size = len(queue)  # Number of nodes at the current level
            level = []  # List to store the current level's node values
            
            for _ in range(level_size):
                node = queue.popleft()  # Remove the node from the queue
                level.append(node.val)  # Add the node's value to the current level
                
                # Enqueue the left and right children if they exist
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            
            result.append(level)  # Append the current level to the result
        
        return result



```


### Comparison Between DFS and BFS:

- **DFS** (Backtracking):
    - Typically used for problems that involve exploring all paths, such as pathfinding or backtracking.
    - Can be easily adapted to store nodes level-wise with recursion, but requires more careful control of the level index.
    - May result in deeper recursion depending on the tree structure.
- **BFS** (Queue):
    - Tailored for level-order traversal since it processes nodes level by level.
    - Uses an explicit queue to manage nodes, leading to a more iterative and intuitive solution.
    - Space complexity can be larger if the tree is wide (many nodes per level).
