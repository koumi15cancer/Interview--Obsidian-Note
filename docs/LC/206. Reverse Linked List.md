- **Initialize Pointers**:
    
    - `prev`: This will point to the previous node, initially set to `None`.
    - `curr`: This will point to the current node, initially set to the head of the list.
    - `next_node`: This will temporarily store the next node during traversal.
- **Iterate Through the List**:
    
    - While `curr` is not `None`, perform the following steps:
        - Store the next node (`next_node`) so you donâ€™t lose the rest of the list.
        - Reverse the link by pointing `curr.next` to `prev`.
        - Move `prev` to `curr` (i.e., `prev` becomes the new head of the reversed portion of the list).
        - Move `curr` to `next_node` (i.e., continue traversal with the next node).
- **Update Head**:
    
    - Once traversal is complete, `prev` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list. Return `prev`.


```python


from typing import Optional

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        curr = head
        
        while curr is not None:
            next_node = curr.next  # Store the next node
            curr.next = prev       # Reverse the current node's pointer
            prev = curr            # Move prev to the current node
            curr = next_node       # Move to the next node in the list
        
        return prev  # prev is the new head of the reversed list
