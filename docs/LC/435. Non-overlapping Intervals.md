# Approach 1: greedy algorithm

- **Sort the Intervals**: First, we sort the intervals based on their ending times. Sorting helps us to easily determine which intervals can overlap.
    
- **Iterate Through the Intervals**: We keep track of the last added interval's end time and compare it with the start time of the current interval.
    
- **Count Overlaps**: If the start time of the current interval is less than or equal to the last interval's end time, it means they overlap, and we need to remove one interval. We increment the count of removals.
    
- **Update the Last Interval's End Time**: If they do not overlap, we update the end time to the current interval's end time.
    
- **Return the Count of Removals**: The final count will represent the minimum number of intervals we need to remove.


```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not intervals:
            return 0
        
        # Step 1: Sort the intervals by their end times
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        count = 0  # To count how many intervals we need to remove
        end = intervals[0][1]  # Initialize the end time of the last added interval
        
        # Step 2: Iterate through the sorted intervals
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][0] < end:  # If the current interval overlaps
                count += 1  # Increment the removal count
            else:
                end = intervals[i][1]  # Update the end time for non-overlapping intervals
        
        return count


```


#### Input:

plaintext

Copy code

`intervals = [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3]]`

#### Steps:

1. **Sorting**:
    
    - After sorting based on the end times, the intervals become:

    Copy code
    
    `[[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 4]]`
    
2. **Initialize Variables**:
    
    - `count = 0`
    - `end = 2` (the end of the first interval)
3. **Iterate Through the Intervals**:
    
    - For `i = 1` (interval `[1, 3]`):
        - `intervals[1][0] < end` (1 < 2) → Overlap, increment `count` to `1`.
    - For `i = 2` (interval `[2, 3]`):
        - `intervals[2][0] < end` (2 < 2) → No overlap, so `end` remains `2`.
    - For `i = 3` (interval `[3, 4]`):
        - `intervals[3][0] < end` (3 < 2) → No overlap, update `end` to `4`.
4. **Final Count**:
    
    - The total number of intervals to remove is `count = 1`.

### Output:

plaintext

Copy code

`1`

This means we need to remove one interval to ensure that the rest of the intervals do not overlap.

By using this greedy approach, we efficiently count the necessary removals with a time complexity of O(nlog⁡n)O(n \log n)O(nlogn) due to the sorting step, followed by a linear scan through the intervals, making it O(n)O(n)O(n). The overall complexity is O(nlog⁡n)O(n \log n)O(nlogn).
