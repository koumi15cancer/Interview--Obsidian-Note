# Approach 1:

- **Constants Definition**:
    
    - `MAX = 0x7FFFFFFF`: This represents the maximum positive integer value in a 32-bit signed integer. In binary, this is `01111111 11111111 11111111 11111111`, which is `2147483647` in decimal.
    - `MASK = 0xFFFFFFFF`: This is used to ensure that we only consider the last 32 bits of any number, essentially simulating the behavior of a 32-bit integer. In binary, this is `11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111`.
- **While Loop**:
    
    - The loop continues until `b` (the carry) becomes `0`. This means that there are no more carries left to add.
- **Carry Calculation**:
    
    - `tmp = (a & b) << 1`: This line calculates the carry.
        - `a & b`: This operation finds the bits that are set in both `a` and `b`, which represent where a carry will occur when adding.
        - `<< 1`: This shifts the carry to the left by one position because the carry affects the next higher bit in the result.
- **Sum without Carry**:
    
    - `a = (a ^ b) & MASK`: This line calculates the sum without considering the carry.
        - `a ^ b`: This operation performs a bitwise XOR between `a` and `b`, which effectively adds the two numbers without carrying. If both bits are `1`, the result is `0`, which is the desired behavior of addition without carry.
        - `& MASK`: This ensures that the result stays within the 32-bit limit.
- **Update Carry**:
    
    - `b = tmp & MASK`: The carry (stored in `tmp`) is assigned to `b`, and `& MASK` ensures it stays within the 32-bit limit. This updated `b` will be used in the next iteration to process the carry.
- **Return Final Result**:
    
    - After the loop, if `a` is greater than `MAX`, it means the result is negative in a 32-bit representation. To convert it back to a negative integer:
        - `~(a ^ MASK)`: This negates `a` and adjusts it according to the rules of two's complement.
    - Finally, the function returns `a` directly if itâ€™s within the positive range, otherwise it returns the adjusted negative value.

Let's take an example with `a = 1` and `b = 2`:

1. **Initial values**:
    
    - `a = 1`, `b = 2`
    - In binary: `a = 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001`, `b = 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010`
2. **First iteration**:
    
    - Calculate carry: `tmp = (1 & 2) << 1 = (0) << 1 = 0`
    - Calculate sum without carry: `a = (1 ^ 2) & MASK = (3) & MASK = 3`
    - Update carry: `b = 0 & MASK = 0`
    - `a = 3`, `b = 0` (exit loop)
3. **Return**:
    
    - Since `a` is `3` (less than `MAX`), it returns `3`.

```python

class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        MAX = 0x7FFFFFFF  # Maximum positive int (32-bit)
        MASK = 0xFFFFFFFF  # Mask to get last 32 bits
        
        while b != 0:
            tmp = (a & b) << 1  # carry calculation
            a = (a ^ b) & MASK  # sum without carry (limit to 32 bits)
            b = tmp & MASK  # carry shifted left (limit to 32 bits)
        
        # If a is greater than MAX, it's a negative number in 32-bit representation
        return a if a <= MAX else ~(a ^ MASK)
