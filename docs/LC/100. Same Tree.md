1. **Base case**: If both `p` and `q` are `None`, we return `True` since two `None` nodes are the same.
2. **Mismatch case**: If either `p` or `q` is `None` (but not both), or their values differ (`p.val != q.val`), we return `False`.
3. **Recursive check**: Recursively check the left subtree (`p.left`, `q.left`) and the right subtree (`p.right`, `q.right`). Both must be `True` for the trees to be considered the same.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)**: Where `n` is the number of nodes in the smaller tree. In the worst case, you have to check all nodes of both trees.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(h)**: Where `h` is the height of the tree, because of the recursion stack. This would be `O(n)` in the worst case for a skewed tree and `O(log n)` for a balanced tree.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        
        if not p and not q:
            return True

        if not p or not q or p.val != q.val:
            return False
        
        return self.isSameTree(p.left,q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right,q.right)
