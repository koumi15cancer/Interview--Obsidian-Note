# Approach 1 BFS - queue

1. **Level-order Traversal**: We use a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS). At each level, we add all nodes' children to the queue.
2. **Rightmost Node**: At each level, we take the rightmost node and add it to the result list.
3. **Queue**: The BFS is implemented using a deque (double-ended queue), where we process nodes level by level.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(N)** where `N` is the number of nodes, since we visit each node exactly once.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(N)** for the queue, which in the worst case holds all nodes of the last level.


```python

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []

        result = []
        queue = deque([root])  # Queue for BFS

        while queue:
            level_length = len(queue)  # Number of nodes at the current level
            for i in range(level_length):
                node = queue.popleft()

                # If it's the rightmost node at the current level, add it to the result
                if i == level_length - 1:
                    result.append(node.val)

                # Add the left and right children to the queue if they exist
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)

        return result


```
# Approach 2:  DFS

- **DFS Traversal**: The DFS function is called recursively on the tree nodes, starting with the right subtree and then the left subtree. This ensures that at each level, the rightmost node is processed first.
    
- **Track Levels**: We maintain a `level` variable to track the current depth of the traversal. If the current level is being visited for the first time (i.e., `level == len(result)`), we add the node's value to the result list.
    
- **Right-first Priority**: Since the right subtree is visited first, the rightmost node at each level gets added to the result before any left-side nodes.

- The DFS will visit nodes in the following order: `1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 5`.
- For each level:
    - At level 0, we visit `1` and add it to the result.
    - At level 1, we visit `3` first, so `3` is added.
    - At level 2, we visit `4`, which is added since it's the rightmost at this level.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(N)**, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree, since every node is visited exactly once.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(H)**, where `H` is the height of the tree, which represents the maximum depth of the recursion stack. In the worst case, the tree could be skewed, making the space complexity `O(N)`.

#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        result = []

        def dfs(node, level):
            if not node:
                return
            
            # If this is the first time we visit this level, add the node value
            if level == len(result):
                result.append(node.val)
            
            # Traverse the right subtree first, then the left subtree
            dfs(node.right, level + 1)
            dfs(node.left, level + 1)

        dfs(root, 0)
        return result
