# Approach 1: Stack-Based Solution

- **Initialize** an empty stack and a variable `max_area` to keep track of the maximum rectangle area.
- **Iterate** through the `heights` array:
    - While the stack is not empty and the current bar is shorter than the bar at the top of the stack, this means we cannot extend a rectangle with the height of the bar at the top of the stack, so we compute the area for that rectangle.
    - The height of the rectangle is determined by the height of the bar at the top of the stack.
    - The width is determined by the difference between the current index and the index of the bar just before the top of the stack (or the beginning of the array if the stack is empty).
- **After the loop**, continue popping from the stack and compute the area for the remaining bars.
- Return the `max_area`.


```python

class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []  # Stack will store indices of the heights
        max_area = 0  # Variable to keep track of the maximum area
        heights.append(0)  # Append a zero to handle remaining bars at the end
        
        for i, h in enumerate(heights):
            # While the current height is smaller than the height of the bar at the top of the stack
            while stack and h < heights[stack[-1]]:
                height = heights[stack.pop()]  # Get the height of the rectangle
                # Determine the width of the rectangle
                width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
                # Calculate the area and update the max_area
                max_area = max(max_area, height * width)
            
            # Push the current index onto the stack
            stack.append(i)
        
        return max_area


```


```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = [-1]
        max_area = 0

        for i in range(len(heights)):
            while stack[-1] != -1 and heights[i] <= heights[stack[-1]]:
                height = heights[stack.pop()]
                width = i - stack[-1] - 1
                max_area = max(max_area, height * width)
            stack.append(i)
        
        while stack[-1] != -1:
            height = heights[stack.pop()]
            width = len(heights) - stack[-1] - 1
            max_area = max(max_area, height * width)
        
        return max_area
