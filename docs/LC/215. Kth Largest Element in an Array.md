Approach 1: Sort and Select

Pseudocode:

1. **Initialization**:
    
    - Use built-in `sorted` function to sort the list `nums` in reverse order (i.e., in descending order).
2. **Selection**:
    
    - Select the k-th element from the sorted list (keeping in mind the zero-based indexing of lists).
3. **Result**:
    
    - The k-th element in the sorted list is the k-th largest element in the original list.

# Complexity:

**Time Complexity:** O(NlogN)

- Sorting a list of N elements requires O(NlogN) time.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

- The space used is constant since we are only sorting the original list and selecting an element from it without utilizing any additional data structures.

```python

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        sorted_nums = sorted(nums,reverse=True)
        return sorted_nums[k - 1]

```


Approach 2: Min-Heap
Pseudocode:

## Key Data Structures:

- **`heap`**:  
    This is a min-heap containing the first `k` elements of `nums`. As we progress, we will modify this heap to ensure it contains the `k` largest elements.

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
    
    - Create a heap with the first `k` elements of `nums`.
    - Transform this list into a min-heap.
2. **Iterate through the List**:
    
    - For each of the remaining elements in `nums`:
        - If the element is larger than the smallest element in the heap (i.e., the top of the heap):
            - Remove the top element from the heap.
            - Insert the current element into the heap.
3. **Result**:
    
    - After processing all elements in `nums`, the top of the heap will contain the `k`th largest element. Return this element.
# Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(nlogk)  
Each of the `n` elements is processed once. However, heap operations take O(logk) time, leading to an overall complexity of O(nlogk).

**Space Complexity:** O(k)  
The solution uses a heap with a maximum of `k` elements.

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heap = nums[:k]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        for num in nums[k:]:
            if num > heap[0]:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
                heapq.heappush(heap, num)
        
        return heap[0]
```

Approach 3: QuickSelect Algorithm ( Time exceed Limit)

Pseudocode:

## Key Data Structures:

- **List/Array**: We use Python's built-in list for this approach. The algorithm modifies the list in place.
- **Pivot**: An element chosen from the list, around which the list gets partitioned.

## Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
    
    - Set the `left` boundary to the beginning of the list and the `right` boundary to the end of the list.
2. **Pivot Selection**:
    
    - Randomly select a pivot index between the `left` and `right` boundaries.
3. **Partitioning**:
    
    - Move all elements smaller than the pivot to its left and all larger elements to its right.
    - Return the final position of the pivot after the partitioning.
4. **Check Pivot Position**:
    
    - If the position of the pivot is the desired k-th largest index, return the pivot.
    - If the pivot's position is greater than the desired index, adjust the `right` boundary and repeat.
    - If the pivot's position is lesser than the desired index, adjust the `left` boundary and repeat.
5. **Result**:
    
    - The function will eventually return the k-th largest element in the original list.


# Complexity:

**Time Complexity**:

- Best and Average Case: O(N)
    
- Worst Case: O(N2)
    
    The average performance is linear. However, in the worst case (very rare, especially with randomized pivot), the algorithm can degrade to O(N2).
    

**Space Complexity**: O(1)

- The space used is constant. The algorithm modifies the original list in place and doesn't utilize any significant additional data structures. The recursive stack calls (in the worst case) are also bounded by the depth of the list, making it O(logN), but this is typically considered as O(1) space complexity in QuickSelect.

```python

class Solution:
     def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums)

        def partition(l, r, p):
            pivot = nums[p]
            i = l+1
            nums[l], nums[p] = nums[p], nums[l]
            while i < r:
                if nums[i] > pivot:
                    nums[l], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[l]
                    i += 1
                    l += 1
                elif nums[i] == pivot: # nums[i] has the same value as pivot, increase the range [left, i]
                    i += 1
                else:
                    r -= 1
                    nums[i], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[i]
            return l, i
        
        while True:
            p = randint(l, r-1)
            m, i = partition(l, r, p)
            if m < k <= i:    # from m th largest to i th largest they are the same, and k is among them
                return nums[m]
            elif k <= m:
                r = m
            elif k > i:
                l = i
```
