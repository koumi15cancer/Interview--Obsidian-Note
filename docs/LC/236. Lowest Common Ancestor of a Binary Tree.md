1. **Base Case**: If the `root` is `None`, return `None`. If the `root` is `p` or `q`, return the `root`.
2. **Recursion**: Recursively check both left and right subtrees for `p` and `q`.
3. **Determine LCA**:
    - If both `left_lca` and `right_lca` are non-null, it means `p` and `q` were found in different subtrees, so the current `root` is their LCA.
    - If only one of the left or right LCA is non-null, return that node, which indicates one of the nodes was found below the current subtree.

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity remains **O(N)**, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree, because we might visit every node in the worst case.

### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

```python

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # If the current node is either p or q, return the current node
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root
        
        # Recur for left and right subtrees
        left_lca = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right_lca = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        
        # If both left and right LCA calls return non-null, root is the LCA
        if left_lca and right_lca:
            return root
        
        # Otherwise, return the non-null child (could be either left or right)
        return left_lca if left_lca is not None else right_lca
