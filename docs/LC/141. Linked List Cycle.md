- **Initialize Two Pointers**:
    
    - `slow`: This pointer moves one step at a time.
    - `fast`: This pointer moves two steps at a time.
- **Traverse the List**:
    
    - While `fast` and `fast.next` are not `None`:
        - Move `slow` one step forward.
        - Move `fast` two steps forward.
        - If `slow` equals `fast` at any point, there is a cycle in the list.
- **Determine the Result**:
    
    - If `fast` reaches the end of the list (`None`), there is no cycle.

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            head = head.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if head is fast:
                return True
        return False


```


```python
from typing import Optional

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next           # Move slow pointer by 1 step
            fast = fast.next.next     # Move fast pointer by 2 steps
            
            if slow == fast:           # Cycle detected
                return True
        
        return False                    # No cycle
