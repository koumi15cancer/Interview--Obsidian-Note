# Approach 1: Stack-Based Approach

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Initialize an empty stack** that will store indices of the bars.
2. Traverse the height array.
3. For each bar (i.e., `height[i]`):
    - While the current bar is **greater** than the bar at the top of the stack, pop the stack:
        - This indicates that we have found a boundary where water can be trapped.
        - The bar at the top of the stack represents the **bottom** of the container where water could be trapped.
        - The **left boundary** of the trapped water is the bar represented by the new top of the stack (after popping).
        - The **right boundary** is the current bar `height[i]`.
4. After processing the current bar, push its index onto the stack.
5. Continue this process until all bars are processed.

### Key Points:

- **Water trapping condition**: Water can only be trapped when the current bar is taller than the bar at the top of the stack (this ensures we have two boundaries and a bottom to form a container for trapping water).
- Once we find this, we calculate the distance between the current bar and the left boundary (new top of the stack after popping) and compute the water volume based on the heights.



```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        trapped_water = 0 
        current = 0

        while current < len(height):
            while stack and height[current] > height[stack[-1]]:
                top = stack.pop()

                if not stack:
                    break
                
                distance = current - stack[-1] -1
                bounded_height = min(height[current], height[stack[-1]]) - height[top]
                trapped_water += distance * bounded_height
            
            stack.append(current)
            current += 1

        return trapped_water

```

# Approach 2: Stack-Based Approach

1. **Two pointers (`left` and `right`)** move towards the center:
    
    - Compare the `left_max` (the maximum height on the left) and `right_max` (the maximum height on the right).
    - If `left_max` is smaller, it means that the amount of water trapped on the left depends on the `left_max`. If the current bar is smaller than `left_max`, water will be trapped.
    - If `right_max` is smaller, it means that the amount of water trapped on the right depends on the `right_max`. If the current bar is smaller than `right_max`, water will be trapped.
2. **Update the trapped water** based on the difference between the current height and the max heights (`left_max` or `right_max`).
    
3. The loop continues until both pointers meet in the middle, ensuring that all bars are checked.
    

### Example Walkthrough:

For the input `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`, the algorithm will calculate the water trapped as:

- Water at index 2: `min(1, 3) - 0 = 1` unit.
- Water at index 4: `min(2, 3) - 1 = 1` unit.
- Water at index 5: `min(2, 3) - 0 = 2` units.
- Water at index 6: `min(2, 3) - 1 = 1` unit.
- Water at index 9: `min(2, 2) - 1 = 1` unit.

Total water trapped = 6 units.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** where `n` is the number of bars, since we traverse the height array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** because we use only a few variables for tracking the max heights and pointers.

This two-pointer approach is optimal both in terms of time and space complexity.


```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0
        
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        left_max, right_max = height[left], height[right]
        trapped_water = 0
        
        while left <= right:
            if left_max <= right_max:
                if height[left] < left_max:
                    trapped_water += left_max - height[left]
                else:
                    left_max = height[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                if height[right] < right_max:
                    trapped_water += right_max - height[right]
                else:
                    right_max = height[right]
                right -= 1
        
        return trapped_water



```


```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        left_max = height[left]
        right_max = height[right]
        water = 0

        while left < right:
            if left_max < right_max:
                left += 1
                left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
                water += left_max - height[left]
            else:
                right -= 1
                right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
                water += right_max - height[right]
        
        return water
