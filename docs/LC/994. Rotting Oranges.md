```python

from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return -1
        
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = set()
        directions = [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]
        fresh_count = 0
        minutes = 0
        queue = deque()

        
        # Step 1: Find initially rotten oranges and count fresh oranges
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 2:
                    queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, minute)
                elif grid[r][c] == 1:
                    fresh_count += 1
        
        # Step 2: Perform BFS
        while queue:
            r, c, minute = queue.popleft()
            minutes = max(minutes, minute)  # Update the minute
            
            for dr, dc in directions:
                new_r, new_c = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= new_r < rows and 0 <= new_c < cols and grid[new_r][new_c] == 1:
                    grid[new_r][new_c] = 2  # Mark as rotten
                    fresh_count -= 1  # Decrement fresh count
                    queue.append((new_r, new_c, minute + 1))  # Add to queue with incremented minute
        
        # Step 3: Check if there are any remaining fresh oranges
        return -1 if fresh_count > 0 else minutes
```


# Approach 2:  DFS

1. **Initialization**:
    
    - We first count the number of fresh oranges (`fresh_oranges`), which we need to track whether all oranges can rot.
    - `max_minutes` is initialized to `0` and is used to track the maximum number of minutes it takes to rot all oranges.
2. **DFS Function**:
    
    - The `dfs` function is responsible for propagating the rot from each rotten orange.
    - It checks all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the current cell. If it finds a fresh orange (`grid[x][y] == 1`), it updates the orange to rotten (`grid[x][y] = 2`) and continues the DFS in the neighboring cells.
    - `minutes` is incremented each time we go deeper into the DFS, indicating the number of minutes passed to rot the current orange.
3. **DFS Calls**:
    
    - We start a DFS from every cell in the grid that contains a rotten orange (`grid[r][c] == 2`). The DFS spreads the rot recursively to adjacent fresh oranges.
4. **Checking Remaining Fresh Oranges**:
    
    - After all DFS calls, we check if any fresh oranges (`grid[r][c] == 1`) are left. If there are still fresh oranges, it means they couldn't be reached by any rotten orange, so we return `-1`.
5. **Return the Result**:
    
    - If no fresh oranges remain, we return `max_minutes`, which represents the time taken to rot all fresh oranges.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. Each cell is visited at most once during the DFS process.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), due to the recursion stack for DFS and the grid itself.

class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        fresh_oranges = 0
        max_minutes = 0
        
        # Track the number of fresh oranges and find the positions of all rotten oranges
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    fresh_oranges += 1

        # Helper function to perform DFS
        def dfs(x, y, minutes):
            nonlocal max_minutes
            # If out of bounds, or it's not a fresh orange, return
            if x < 0 or x >= rows or y < 0 or y >= cols or grid[x][y] != 1:
                return

            # Update the fresh orange to rotten
            grid[x][y] = 2
            max_minutes = max(max_minutes, minutes)
            
            # Explore all 4 directions
            dfs(x - 1, y, minutes + 1)  # Up
            dfs(x + 1, y, minutes + 1)  # Down
            dfs(x, y - 1, minutes + 1)  # Left
            dfs(x, y + 1, minutes + 1)  # Right
        
        # Start DFS from every rotten orange (2) in the grid
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 2:
                    dfs(r, c, 0)
        
        # Check if there are any fresh oranges left
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:  # Fresh orange still exists
                    return -1

        return max_minutes
