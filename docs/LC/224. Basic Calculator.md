# Approach 1:
### Explanation:

1. **Stack**: The `stack` is used to handle expressions inside parentheses.
2. **Current Number**: `current_number` keeps track of the number being read.
3. **Result**: The variable `result` stores the ongoing calculation.
4. **Sign**: The `sign` variable holds whether the current operation is addition (`+`) or subtraction (`-`).
5. **Main Logic**:
    - If the character is a digit, it updates the `current_number`.
    - If the character is `+` or `-`, it calculates the result for the previous number, applies the previous sign, and updates the `sign` for the next operation.
    - If it encounters an opening parenthesis `(`, it pushes the `result` and `sign` onto the stack and resets the `result` and `sign` for the expression inside the parentheses.
    - If it encounters a closing parenthesis `)`, it evaluates the expression inside the parentheses by popping the stack and updating the result.


```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        stack = []
        current_number = 0
        result = 0
        sign = 1  # 1 represents positive, -1 represents negative

        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '+':
                result += sign * current_number
                sign = 1
                current_number = 0
            elif char == '-':
                result += sign * current_number
                sign = -1
                current_number = 0
            elif char == '(':
                # Push current result and sign onto the stack
                stack.append(result)
                stack.append(sign)
                result = 0
                sign = 1
            elif char == ')':
                # Compute the expression inside parentheses
                result += sign * current_number
                result *= stack.pop()  # This is the sign before the parenthesis
                result += stack.pop()  # This is the result before the parenthesis
                current_number = 0

        return result + sign * current_number
