Approach 1: use default dict to store sorted word as key, value as list of word
Pseudocode:
- consider edge case len(strs) < 2, return [strs]
- Declare defaultdict(list)
- Iterate each word in strs:
	-  Preprocess word as sorted word
	- Append word value based on sorted word key
return list of group anagram
- TC: O(N)
- SP: O(N)


```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:

        # Using defaultdict to avoid key errors
        anagram_dict = defaultdict(list)
        
        for word in strs:
            sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
            anagram_dict[sorted_word].append(word)
        
        return list(anagram_dict.values())
```

Approach 2: Â Basic idea of solution 2 is the same as solution 1, but difference between solution 1 and solution 2 is that we don't have to sort each character.

pseudocode:
- **Initialization**:
    
    - A `defaultdict` named `ans` is initialized. It will store lists of strings (anagrams) where the key is a tuple representing the character frequency.
- **Loop over Each String in `strs`**:
    
    - For each string `s`, a `count` list of size 26 (representing each letter from 'a' to 'z') is initialized with zeros.
- **Counting Characters**:
    
    - For each character `c` in the string `s`, the corresponding position in the `count` list (based on the character's ASCII value) is incremented. This tracks how many times each letter appears in the string `s`.
- **Group Anagrams**:
    
    - Convert the `count` list to a tuple and use it as a key in the `ans` dictionary. Append the current string `s` to the list associated with this key.
- **Return**:
    
    - Finally, return all values in the `ans` dictionary, which are the grouped anagrams.
- TC: O(N). (O(n * k))
- SP: O(N). (O(n * k))


```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:    
        ans = defaultdict(list)

        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26

            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1
            ans[tuple(count)].append(s)
        
        return ans.values()
```
