# Approach 1: 

- **In-order Traversal**:
    
    - We use an iterative approach with a stack to simulate the recursive in-order traversal.
    - In-order traversal processes nodes in the order: left subtree → current node → right subtree, which results in a sorted order in a BST.
- **Stack**:
    
    - The stack is used to keep track of nodes as we traverse down the left subtree.
    - After visiting a node, we pop it from the stack, which represents visiting the current node.
- **Decrement `k`**:
    
    - We decrement `k` each time we visit a node.
    - When `k == 0`, it means we have found the `kth` smallest element.
- **Iterate**:
    
    - Once a node is processed, the algorithm moves to the right subtree.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)** in the worst case if the tree is completely unbalanced (skewed).
- On average, for balanced trees, it will visit `k` nodes, making it **O(k)**.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree due to the stack used for in-order traversal. In the worst case, the space complexity could be **O(n)** if the tree is completely unbalanced, or **O(log n)** for a balanced tree.

This solution ensures the `kth` smallest element is returned efficiently.


```python

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        # Initialize a stack for in-order traversal
        stack = []
        current = root
        
        # Iterate until the stack is empty or we find the kth smallest element
        while True:
            # Go to the leftmost node
            while current:
                stack.append(current)
                current = current.left
            
            # Pop the element from the stack
            current = stack.pop()
            k -= 1  # Decrement k, as we've found one smaller element
            
            # If k is 0, the current element is the kth smallest
            if k == 0:
                return current.val
            
            # Move to the right node
            current = current.right

```


# Approach 2: 

Use in-order traversal because it will visit nodes in ascending order in a BST.

Store the node values in a list during traversal.

After traversal, retrieve the k-th smallest element from the list using the index k-1 (due to zero-based indexing).

```python

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        self.result = []

        def inorder(node):
            if node is None:
                return
            inorder(node.left)
            self.result.append(node.val)
            inorder(node.right)
        
        inorder(root)
        return self.result[k-1]
```
