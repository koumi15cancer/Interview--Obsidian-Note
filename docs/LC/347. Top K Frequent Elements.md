### Problem Explanation:

- **Input:**
    
    - You are given an integer array `nums`, which can contain duplicates.
    - You are also given an integer `k` which represents how many of the most frequent elements you need to return.
- **Output:**
    
    - The goal is to return an array of the `k` most frequent elements from the input array `nums`.
- **Example:**
    
    - Input: `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]`, `k = 2`
    - Output: `[1,2]`
        - In this case, `1` appears 3 times, `2` appears 2 times, and `3` appears 1 time. Since `k = 2`, we need the top 2 most frequent elements, which are `1` and `2`.

### Key Details:

1. **Frequency Calculation:**
    
    - To determine which elements are the most frequent, we first need to calculate the frequency of each element in `nums`. This can be done using a frequency map (or dictionary) where each key is a unique element, and the value is its count.
2. **Sorting or Heaps:**
    
    - Once the frequencies are determined, we need a way to find the top `k` frequent elements. This can be done by either:
        - **Sorting** the elements by their frequency in descending order and then selecting the top `k` elements.
        - Using a **heap** (priority queue) to efficiently find the top `k` frequent elements without having to sort the entire frequency map.

### Common Approaches to Solve the Problem:

1. **Using a Hash Map and Sorting:**
    
    - Step 1: Count the frequency of each element in `nums` using a hash map.
    - Step 2: Sort the elements based on their frequencies.
    - Step 3: Return the top `k` elements from the sorted list.
2. **Using a Heap (Priority Queue):**
    
    - Step 1: Count the frequency of each element in `nums` using a hash map.
    - Step 2: Use a min-heap to keep track of the `k` most frequent elements. The heap allows you to maintain the top `k` elements efficiently, as adding and removing elements from a heap is faster than sorting all elements.
    - Step 3: Return the elements in the heap as the result.


# Approach 1: Hash map and sorting

1. **Step 1:**
    
    - We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, which automatically creates a hash map that stores the frequency of each element in `nums`.
2. **Step 2:**
    
    - The `most_common(k)` method of `Counter` returns a list of the `k` most common elements (sorted by frequency).
    - We return the elements directly from the `most_common` list.

#### Time Complexity:

- **Frequency Calculation:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is the time needed to build the frequency map.
    
- **Sorting:** O(n log n) due to sorting the elements by their frequency.
    
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n log n), dominated by the sorting step.

```python

from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Create a frequency map using Counter
        count = Counter(nums)  # Counter gives a dictionary with the frequency of each element
        
        # Step 2: Sort the elements by frequency and get the top k frequent elements
        # key=lambda x: count[x] sorts the elements by their frequency
        return [item for item, freq in count.most_common(k)]

```

# Approach 2: Heap

- **Count the Frequency of Each Element:**
    
    - Similar to the hashmap approach, we start by iterating through the `nums` array to calculate the frequency of each element using a hash map (or Pythonâ€™s `Counter` class).
- **Build a Min-Heap:**
    
    - Once we have the frequency of each element, we push each element into a **min-heap**. However, we limit the heap size to `k` elements.
    - We push elements into the heap as tuples of `(frequency, element)` so that the heap can compare frequencies.
    - If the heap grows larger than `k`, we remove the element with the smallest frequency (because we are only interested in the top `k` frequent elements).
- **Extract the Top `k` Frequent Elements:**
    
    - After processing all elements, the heap will contain the `k` most frequent elements.
    - We then extract the elements from the heap and return them.


```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Create a frequency map using Counter
        count = Counter(nums)  # Counter gives a dictionary with the frequency of each element
        
        # Step 2: Use a heap to keep the top k elements
        # heapq.nlargest(k, iterable, key) returns the k largest elements from the iterable
        return [item for item, freq in heapq.nlargest(k, count.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])]


```

```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Create a frequency map using Counter
        count = Counter(nums)  # Counter gives a dictionary with the frequency of each element
        
        # Step 2: Initialize a min-heap
        heap = []
        
        # Step 3: Add elements to the heap and maintain its size as k
        for num, freq in count.items():
            heapq.heappush(heap, (freq, num))  # Push the tuple (frequency, element)
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)  # If heap size exceeds k, pop the smallest frequency element
        
        # Step 4: Extract elements from the heap
        return [num for freq, num in heap]
