You are given an `m x n` board of characters and a list of strings called `words`. Your task is to find all words in the given list that exist in the board.

Each word must be constructed by letters that are **sequentially adjacent** cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. A word cannot use the same letter cell more than once.

#### Example 1:

css

Copy code

`Input: board = [   ['o','a','a','n'],   ['e','t','a','e'],   ['i','h','k','r'],   ['i','f','l','v'] ] words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]  Output: ["oath","eat"]`

#### Example 2:

css

Copy code

`Input: board = [['a','b'],['c','d']] words = ["abcb"]  Output: []`

#### Constraints:

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 12`
- `1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- Each `words[i]` and `board[i][j]` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Key Points:

- You are given a 2D board and a list of words to search within the board.
- The words must be formed by adjacent letters (horizontally or vertically) on the board.
- You cannot reuse the same board cell in constructing a word.
- The goal is to find all valid words that can be formed from the board.

# Approach 1: Brute Force

The brute force approach is straightforward but inefficient for large inputs. Here's how it works:

#### Approach:

- For each word in the `words` list, perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from every cell in the board.
- Try to match the word letter by letter by moving in all 4 possible directions: up, down, left, and right.
- If all letters of the word are matched, mark the word as found.
- Repeat this for all words in the list.

```python
class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        result = []

        def dfs(board, word, i, j, index):
            if index == len(word):  # If we have matched all letters
                return True
            if i < 0 or i >= len(board) or j < 0 or j >= len(board[0]) or board[i][j] != word[index]:
                return False

            temp = board[i][j]  # Temporarily mark the cell as visited
            board[i][j] = "#"  # Mark as visited

            # Explore all 4 directions
            found = (dfs(board, word, i+1, j, index+1) or 
                     dfs(board, word, i-1, j, index+1) or 
                     dfs(board, word, i, j+1, index+1) or 
                     dfs(board, word, i, j-1, index+1))

            board[i][j] = temp  # Unmark the cell
            return found

        for word in words:  # For each word
            for i in range(len(board)):  # For each cell in the board
                for j in range(len(board[0])):
                    if dfs(board, word, i, j, 0):  # Perform DFS
                        result.append(word)
                        break  # No need to search further for this word

        return result


```


#### Time Complexity:

- **O(W * m * n * 4^L)** where `W` is the number of words, `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns, and `L` is the length of the longest word. It tries to match each word from every position in the grid.

#### Space Complexity:

- **O(L)** for the recursion stack in DFS where `L` is the length of the longest word.


# Approach 2: DFS + Trie (Optimized Approach)

By using a Trie (Prefix Tree), we can significantly improve performance by sharing prefixes of words and avoiding redundant searches. This allows us to explore multiple words simultaneously.

#### Approach:

1. **Build a Trie** from the `words` list.
2. Perform **DFS** on the board to explore cells, starting from every cell.
3. During DFS, use the Trie to check if the current path corresponds to a valid prefix of any word.
4. If we reach the end of a word, add it to the result.
5. Mark words as found in the Trie to avoid duplicate searches.

```python

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_word = False

class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        root = self.buildTrie(words)
        result = set()  # Use a set to avoid duplicates

        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                self.dfs(board, i, j, root, "", result)

        return list(result)

    def buildTrie(self, words):
        root = TrieNode()
        for word in words:
            node = root
            for char in word:
                if char not in node.children:
                    node.children[char] = TrieNode()
                node = node.children[char]
            node.is_word = True
        return root

    def dfs(self, board, i, j, node, path, result):
        if node.is_word:
            result.add(path)  # Add the found word
            node.is_word = False  # Avoid duplicate words

        if i < 0 or i >= len(board) or j < 0 or j >= len(board[0]) or board[i][j] not in node.children:
            return

        char = board[i][j]
        board[i][j] = "#"  # Mark the cell as visited

        # Explore all 4 directions
        for x, y in [(i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j+1), (i, j-1)]:
            self.dfs(board, x, y, node.children[char], path + char, result)

        board[i][j] = char  # Unmark the cell



```

#### Time Complexity:

- **O(m * n * 4^L + W * L)** where `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns, `L` is the length of the longest word, and `W` is the number of words. The Trie construction takes `O(W * L)`, and DFS exploration takes `O(m * n * 4^L)`.

#### Space Complexity:

- **O(W * L)** for the Trie and **O(L)** for the recursion stack during DFS.


# Approach 3: Backtracking Approach

#### Approach:

- Start DFS from every cell in the board.
- Explore all 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
- If the current path leads to a valid word, add it to the result.
- Backtrack after each exploration by undoing changes to the board, such as marking/unmarking visited cells.
- This is combined with a Trie to prune invalid paths early.

#### Implementation:

The DFS + Trie implementation already incorporates backtracking principles. The key idea is to explore, then unmark cells to allow for further explorations.


```python
class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        result = set()  # To store the found words
        rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])
        
        # Function to perform backtracking
        def backtrack(i, j, node, path):
            if node.is_word:  # If we found a word
                result.add(path)  # Add it to the result
                node.is_word = False  # Prevent duplicate entries
            
            # Explore all 4 possible directions
            for x, y in [(i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j+1), (i, j-1)]:
                if 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < cols and board[x][y] in node.children:
                    char = board[x][y]
                    board[x][y] = "#"  # Mark as visited
                    
                    backtrack(x, y, node.children[char], path + char)  # Continue the search

                    board[x][y] = char  # Unmark to allow future searches

        # Build a Trie from the list of words
        root = self.buildTrie(words)

        # Start backtracking from every cell in the board
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if board[i][j] in root.children:  # Start only if there's a potential match
                    char = board[i][j]
                    board[i][j] = "#"  # Mark as visited
                    backtrack(i, j, root.children[char], char)  # Start backtracking
                    board[i][j] = char  # Unmark after backtracking

        return list(result)

    # Function to build the Trie
    def buildTrie(self, words):
        class TrieNode:
            def __init__(self):
                self.children = {}
                self.is_word = False
        
        root = TrieNode()
        for word in words:
            node = root
            for char in word:
                if char not in node.children:
                    node.children[char] = TrieNode()
                node = node.children[char]
            node.is_word = True
        return root
