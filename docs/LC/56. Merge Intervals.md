# Approach 1:


1. **Define Helper Functions**:
    
    - **`is_overlap(a, b)`**: This function checks if two intervals `a` and `b` overlap. The condition for overlap is that the start of one interval is less than or equal to the end of the other interval.
    - **`merge_overlapping_intervals(a, b)`**: This function merges two overlapping intervals `a` and `b` by creating a new interval with the minimum start and maximum end.
2. **Sort the Intervals**:
    
    - The intervals are sorted based on the start time using `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])`. This ensures that we can check for overlaps in a sequential manner.
3. **Initialize Result List**:
    
    - We initialize the result list with the first interval: `result = [intervals[0]]`.
4. **Iterate Through Intervals**:
    
    - We iterate through the sorted list of intervals starting from the second interval. For each interval:
        - Check if it overlaps with the last interval in the result list using `is_overlap(result[-1], interval)`.
        - If they overlap, merge the two intervals and update the last interval in the result list.
        - If they do not overlap, simply add the current interval to the result list.
5. **Return Result**:
    
    - Finally, return the merged list of intervals.

### Dry Code Representation

Let's represent this process in a dry code format, including some example intervals:



```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Step 1: Define helper functions
        def is_overlap(a, b):
            return a[0] <= b[1] and b[0] <= a[1]
        
        def merge_overlapping_intervals(a, b):
            return [min(a[0], b[0]), max(a[1], b[1])]

        # Step 2: Sort the intervals
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Example: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]] -> [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
        
        # Step 3: Initialize result with the first interval
        result = [intervals[0]]  # result = [[1,3]]
        
        # Step 4: Iterate through the intervals
        for interval in intervals[1:]:  # interval = [2,6]
            if is_overlap(result[-1], interval):  # Check overlap with last in result
                # Overlapping case
                result[-1] = merge_overlapping_intervals(result[-1], interval)  # result[-1] = [1,6]
            else:
                # Non-overlapping case
                result.append(interval)  # result = [[1,6], [8,10]]

        # Step 5: Return the merged intervals
        return result  # Example output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]


```

```python

class Solution:
        
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        def is_overlap(a, b):
            return a[0] <= b[1] and b[0] <= a[1]
    
        def merge_overlapping_intervals(a, b):
            return [min(a[0], b[0]), max(a[1], b[1])]
        
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        result = [intervals[0]]
        for interval in intervals[1:]:
            if is_overlap(result[-1],interval):
                result[-1] = merge_overlapping_intervals(result[-1],interval)
            else:
                result.append(interval)

        return result
