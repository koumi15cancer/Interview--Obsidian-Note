# Approach 1:

1. The function keeps dividing the number nnn by `2` (shifting right) until nnn becomes `0`.
2. At each recursive call, it checks whether the least significant bit (LSB) is `1` or `0`:
    - If `1`, it adds `1` to the total count.
    - If `0`, it adds `0` (doesn't change the count).
3. This process continues until all bits of `n` have been processed, ultimately yielding the total count of `1`s in the binary representation of the original number.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's say n=11n = 11n=11 (binary `1011`):

1. **First Call**: `hammingWeight(11)`
    - `11 // 2 = 5` and `11 % 2 = 1` → Result so far: `1`
2. **Second Call**: `hammingWeight(5)`
    - `5 // 2 = 2` and `5 % 2 = 1` → Result so far: `2`
3. **Third Call**: `hammingWeight(2)`
    - `2 // 2 = 1` and `2 % 2 = 0` → Result so far: `2`
4. **Fourth Call**: `hammingWeight(1)`
    - `1 // 2 = 0` and `1 % 2 = 1` → Result so far: `3`
5. **Fifth Call**: `hammingWeight(0)`
    - Returns `0`.

### Final Result

The function unwinds, adding all the results together: `1 (from 11) + 1 (from 5) + 0 (from 2) + 1 (from 1) + 0 (from 0) = 3`. Thus, the Hamming weight of `11` is `3`, which is correct since there are three `1`s in the binary representation of `11` (`1011`).

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n==0:
            return 0
        return self.hammingWeight(n//2) + (n % 2)
