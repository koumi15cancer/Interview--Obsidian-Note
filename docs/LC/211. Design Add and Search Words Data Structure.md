1. **Trie Structure**:
    
    - A tree-like structure where each node represents a letter of a word.
    - Words are stored by breaking them into characters, with paths from the root node forming different words.
    - Each node tracks whether it's the end of a word.
2. **Adding Words**:
    
    - Start at the root and follow the path for each character.
    - If a character doesn't exist in the current path, create a new node for it.
    - Mark the final node as the end of the word.
3. **Searching Words**:
    
    - Traverse the Trie for each character in the word.
    - If a `.` is encountered, check all possible child nodes (since `.` matches any character).
    - Continue this process until the entire word is processed. If you reach a valid end node, the word is found.

In summary:

- The Trie efficiently stores words character by character.
- Searching supports `.` as a wildcard by exploring all possible paths at that position.

```python

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_word = False
        
class WordDictionary:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()      

    def addWord(self, word):
        current_node = self.root
        for character in word:
            current_node = current_node.children.setdefault(character, TrieNode())
        current_node.is_word = True
        
    def search(self, word):
        def dfs(node, index):
            if index == len(word):
                return node.is_word
               
            if word[index] == ".":
                for child in node.children.values():
                    if dfs(child, index+1):
                        return True
                    
            if word[index] in node.children:
                return dfs(node.children[word[index]], index+1)
            
            return False
    
        return dfs(self.root, 0)
