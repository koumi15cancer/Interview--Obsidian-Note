### Problem Statement:

You are given `n` courses labeled from `0` to `n-1` and a list of prerequisites where each element in the list is a pair `[a, b]`, indicating that you must take course `b` before taking course `a`.

For example, if `prerequisites = [[1,0]]`, it means that to take course `1`, you must first complete course `0`.

The task is to determine whether it is **possible to finish all the courses**. This is essentially asking if there is a valid way to complete all courses given the prerequisites (i.e., checking if there are any cycles in the dependency graph).

### Key Points:

- **Courses are represented as nodes** in a directed graph.
- **Prerequisites are represented as directed edges** from one course to another.
    - If course `b` is a prerequisite for course `a`, there's an edge from `b` to `a`.
- You need to check whether it's possible to take all courses, meaning **whether the graph contains a cycle** or not.
    - If there is a cycle, it’s **impossible to complete the courses**, because it would create a deadlock (e.g., course A requires course B, but course B also requires course A).
    - If there's **no cycle**, it's possible to finish all the courses.

### Graph Representation:

- You can think of each course as a **node** in a directed graph.
- The **prerequisite** relationship is represented as a **directed edge** from one node (course) to another.

### Example:

Suppose there are 4 courses and the prerequisites are `[[1,0],[2,1],[3,2]]`. This means:

- To take course `1`, you need to complete course `0` first.
- To take course `2`, you need to complete course `1` first.
- To take course `3`, you need to complete course `2` first.

This forms a linear dependency graph:

Copy code

`0 → 1 → 2 → 3`

In this case, it is possible to complete all the courses because there are no cycles.

However, if the prerequisites were `[[1,0],[0,1]]`, there would be a cycle (course `1` depends on course `0`, but course `0` also depends on course `1`), making it **impossible to complete all courses**.

### The Problem as a Graph Cycle Detection:

The problem boils down to **detecting cycles in a directed graph**. If there are no cycles, it's possible to complete all the courses; otherwise, it's not.

### General Approach:

To determine whether all courses can be finished, the key steps are:

1. **Build a graph**: Represent the courses and prerequisites as a graph.
2. **Check for cycles** in the graph using techniques such as:
    - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: To detect cycles in the graph.
    - **Topological Sorting**: If a valid topological order exists, it means there are no cycles.
    - **Kahn’s Algorithm** (based on in-degrees): Another way to find a topological order iteratively.

### Output:

- **True**: If you can complete all the courses (i.e., there are no cycles).
- **False**: If it’s impossible to complete all the courses (i.e., there is a cycle in the graph).

# Approach 1: Topological Sort

- **Build the graph and in-degree array:**
    
    - For each prerequisite pair `[a, b]` where `b` is a prerequisite for `a`, add an edge from `b` to `a` in the graph.
    - Track the in-degree of each course (number of prerequisites).
- **Initialize the queue:**
    
    - Start with all courses that have an in-degree of `0`, meaning they can be taken immediately.
- **Process the queue:**
    
    - Remove a course from the queue (meaning you're taking it).
    - For each course that depends on the course you just removed, reduce its in-degree.
    - If the in-degree of a dependent course becomes `0`, add it to the queue (it can now be taken).
- **Check the result:**
    
    - If all courses have been processed (i.e., all nodes have been removed from the graph), return `True`.
    - If there are still courses left with in-degrees greater than `0`, it means there's a cycle, and it's impossible to complete all courses, so return `False`.

                if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
