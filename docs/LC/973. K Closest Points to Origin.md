# Approach 1:

```python

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        sort = []
        for position in points:
            distance = (position[0] ** 2 + position[1] ** 2) ** 0.5
            heapq.heappush(sort,(distance,position))
        result = []
        for i in range(k):
            _,position = heapq.heappop(sort)
            result.append(position)
        return result
            
            
        
```

# Approach 2:

```python

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        heap = []
        for id, p in enumerate(points):
            distance = p[0] ** 2 + p[1] ** 2
            heapq.heappush(heap,(-distance,id))
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
         
        return [points[id] for _, id in heap]
            
            
        

```


# Approach 3:

```python

from heapq import heappush, heappop

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        heap = []
        
        def distance(point):
            return point[0] ** 2 + point[1] ** 2
        
        for point in points:
            dist = distance(point)
            heappush(heap, (dist, point))
            
        result = []
        
        for _ in range(k):
            result.append(heappop(heap)[1])
            
        return result
            
            
```
