The problem asks you to implement a data structure that efficiently supports the following two operations:

1. **Adding a number** to a data stream of integers.
2. **Finding the median** of all the numbers added so far.

#### What is a Median?

The median is the middle value in an ordered set of numbers:

- **If the size of the data stream is odd**, the median is the middle element.
- **If the size of the data stream is even**, the median is the average of the two middle elements.


# Approach 1: Heap based approach

1. **Initialization**:
    
    - `self.low`: A max-heap (simulated by pushing negative numbers into Python's min-heap).
    - `self.high`: A regular min-heap.
2. **Adding a number (`addNum`)**:
    
    - We first push the number into the `low` heap (inverted to act like a max-heap).
    - Then, we move the maximum element from `low` to `high` to ensure all elements in `low` are smaller than those in `high`.
    - If `high` has more elements than `low`, we move the smallest element from `high` back to `low`.
3. **Finding the median (`findMedian`)**:
    
    - If `low` has more elements, the median is the top of `low` (which is the largest of the smaller half of numbers).
    - If `low` and `high` have the same number of elements, the median is the average of the tops of `low` and `high`.

### Time Complexity:

- **addNum**: O(log n) due to the heap insertion and balancing.
- **findMedian**: O(1) because accessing the top of the heap is constant time.
### Example Walkthrough:

Let's see how the algorithm works with a stream of numbers:

1. Add 1:
    - `low = [1]`, `high = []` → Median = 1
2. Add 2:
    - `low = [1]`, `high = [2]` → Median = (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5
3. Add 3:
    - `low = [1, 2]`, `high = [3]` → Median = 2
4. Add 4:
    - `low = [2, 1]`, `high = [3, 4]` → Median = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

```python
import heapq

class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        # Max-heap for the smaller half of the numbers
        self.low = []  # Python's heapq is a min-heap, so we'll store negative values to simulate a max-heap
        # Min-heap for the larger half of the numbers
        self.high = []
    
    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        # Add to max-heap (low)
        heapq.heappush(self.low, -num)
        
        # Balance the heaps: the max element of low should be smaller than the min element of high
        heapq.heappush(self.high, -heapq.heappop(self.low))
        
        # Ensure low heap has at least as many elements as high heap
        if len(self.low) < len(self.high):
            heapq.heappush(self.low, -heapq.heappop(self.high))
    
    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        # If low has more elements, the median is the top of low
        if len(self.low) > len(self.high):
            return -self.low[0]
        # If the two heaps are balanced, the median is the average of the tops of the two heaps
        return (-self.low[0] + self.high[0]) / 2


```


```python

class MedianFinder:

    def __init__(self):
        # Min-heap for the larger half of the numbers
        self.minHeapForLargeNum = []
        # Max-heap for the smaller half of the numbers (invert numbers to use
        # heapq as a max-heap)
        self.maxHeapForSmallNum = []

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        if len(self.maxHeapForSmallNum) == 0 or -self.maxHeapForSmallNum[0] >= num:
            heapq.heappush(self.maxHeapForSmallNum, -num)
        else:
            heapq.heappush(self.minHeapForLargeNum, num)

        # Balance the heaps
        if len(self.maxHeapForSmallNum) > len(self.minHeapForLargeNum) + 1:
            heapq.heappush(
                self.minHeapForLargeNum, -heapq.heappop(self.maxHeapForSmallNum)
            )
        elif len(self.maxHeapForSmallNum) < len(self.minHeapForLargeNum):
            heapq.heappush(
                self.maxHeapForSmallNum, -heapq.heappop(self.minHeapForLargeNum)
            )

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        if len(self.maxHeapForSmallNum) == len(self.minHeapForLargeNum):
            return (-self.maxHeapForSmallNum[0] + self.minHeapForLargeNum[0]) / 2.0
        else:
            return -self.maxHeapForSmallNum[0]


# Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MedianFinder()
# obj.addNum(num)
# param_2 = obj.findMedian()

```
# Approach 2: Dynamic Array:

- **Store Elements in a List**: Maintain a list to store all the elements received from the stream.
- **Insert Elements**: Each time a new number is added, append it to the list.
- **Sort the List**: After adding each number, sort the list to maintain order. This allows easy access to the median.
- **Finding the Median**:
    - If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element.
    - If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

1. **Initialization**:
    
    - `self.nums`: A list that will hold all the numbers added from the data stream.
2. **Adding a Number (`addNum`)**:
    
    - Append the new number to the list.
    - Sort the list to ensure that elements are in order.
3. **Finding the Median (`findMedian`)**:
    
    - If the number of elements is odd, return the middle element of the sorted list.
    - If the number of elements is even, return the average of the two middle elements.

### Time Complexity:

- **addNum**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
- **findMedian**: O(1) because accessing the median elements is constant time.


```python
class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nums = []  # List to store numbers
    
    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        self.nums.append(num)  # Append the number to the list
        self.nums.sort()  # Sort the list after adding a new number
    
    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        n = len(self.nums)  # Get the current size of the list
        if n % 2 == 1:
            return float(self.nums[n // 2])  # Return the middle element for odd size
        else:
            return (self.nums[n // 2 - 1] + self.nums[n // 2]) / 2  # Return the average of the two middle elements for even size



```


### Example Walkthrough:

Let’s see how this approach works with a stream of numbers:

1. Add 1:
    - `nums = [1]` → Median = 1
2. Add 2:
    - `nums = [1, 2]` → Median = (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5
3. Add 3:
    - `nums = [1, 2, 3]` → Median = 2
4. Add 4:
    - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]` → Median = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
