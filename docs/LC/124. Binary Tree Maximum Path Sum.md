The **Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum** problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of a path in a binary tree. A path is defined as any sequence of nodes from one node to another (not necessarily starting at the root or ending at a leaf). The sum for each path is the sum of the node values along the path.

For solving this problem, **Depth-First Search (DFS)** is the preferred approach, as it allows us to explore all paths and compute the maximum path sum in a recursive manner. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is not typically suitable for this problem because we need to evaluate the tree depth-wise rather than level-wise.

# Approach 1: DFS Approach

1. **Maximum path sum including the node as the highest point**: This considers paths going through the left and right subtrees, adding the node's value.
2. **Maximum path sum going through one side only**: This is to ensure the path sum remains valid as part of the final result (i.e., the path can't split into both left and right subtrees and continue upwards).

### Plan:

1. For each node, calculate the maximum path sum passing through the left and right children.
2. For each node, keep track of:
    - The maximum path sum that includes the current node and can extend upwards.
    - The overall maximum path sum at any point in the tree.
3. Recursively return the maximum sum that can be extended to the parent node.

### DFS Pseudocode:

- Traverse each node recursively, computing the maximum path sum for each subtree.
- Update the global maximum path sum at each node.
- At each node, return the maximum sum including the node and one of its subtrees to the parent.

### Key Points:

1. **Global Maximum (`self.max_sum`)**: We update the global maximum path sum with every node's computed local maximum.
2. **DFS Recursive Traversal**: The `dfs` function recursively calculates the maximum path sum for each subtree.
3. **Negative Subtree Handling**: If a subtreeâ€™s maximum path sum is negative, we ignore it by taking `max(left_max, 0)` or `max(right_max, 0)`.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)**: We visit each node once, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(h)**: Where `h` is the height of the tree, representing the recursion stack space. In the worst case (skewed tree), this is `O(n)`, but for a balanced tree, it's `O(log n)`.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left

class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.max_sum = float('-inf')  # Initialize the global max sum

        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return 0  # Return 0 if the node is None
            
            # Compute max path sum for left and right subtrees (ignore negative sums)
            left_max = max(dfs(node.left), 0)
            right_max = max(dfs(node.right), 0)

            # Compute the max path sum passing through this node
            local_max = node.val + left_max + right_max

            # Update the global maximum path sum
            self.max_sum = max(self.max_sum, local_max)

            # Return the max sum considering either left or right subtree to continue the path
            return node.val + max(left_max, right_max)

        dfs(root)
        return self.max_sum  # Return the global maximum path sum
