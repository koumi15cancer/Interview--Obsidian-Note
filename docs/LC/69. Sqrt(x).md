# Approach 1:

Let's dry run the function for x=8x = 8x=8.

1. **Initialization:**
    
    - Input: x=8x = 8x=8
    - Initialize `number` to 1.
2. **First Iteration:**
    
    - Check: 1∗1≤81 * 1 \leq 81∗1≤8 (True)
    - Increment `number`: `number = 2`
3. **Second Iteration:**
    
    - Check: 2∗2≤82 * 2 \leq 82∗2≤8 (True)
    - Increment `number`: `number = 3`
4. **Third Iteration:**
    
    - Check: 3∗3≤83 * 3 \leq 83∗3≤8 (False)
    - The condition fails, so exit the loop.
5. **Return Value:**
    
    - Return `number - 1`: 3−1=23 - 1 = 23−1=2

### Conclusion

The function returns 222, which is the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to 888 (i.e., 22=42^2 = 422=4 and 32=93^2 = 932=9).

```python

class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        number = 1
        while number * number <= x:
            number+=1
        return number - 1

```


# Approach 2:

### Approach Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   The function initializes a variable `number` to 1. This variable will be incremented to find the integer whose square is less than or equal to the input `x`.

2. **Iterative Loop:**
   The loop continues while `number^2 <= x`.
   - Each iteration checks if the square of `number` is still less than or equal to `x`.
   - If it is, `number` is incremented by 1.
   - When `number^2 > x`, the loop stops, because we have passed the point where `number^2` is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Return Statement:**
   - After the loop exits (when `number^2` is greater than `x`), the function returns `number - 1`. This is because `number` was incremented one step too far—beyond the point where `number^2 <= x`.
   - `number - 1` gives the largest integer whose square is still less than or equal to `x`.

### Why It Works:

- The loop starts at 1 and increments `number` step by step. For each step, it checks if `number^2` is still less than or equal to `x`.
- Once `number^2` exceeds `x`, we know that the previous `number` was the correct answer.
- The method simply counts up until it finds the integer value for which the square is larger than `x`, ensuring the result is the correct integer square root.

### Example Walkthrough:

For `x = 8`:
- Initially, `number = 1`, and `1^2 = 1 <= 8`.
- The loop increments `number` to 2, and `2^2 = 4 <= 8`.
- Then `number` becomes 3, and `3^2 = 9`, which is greater than 8.
- Since `9 > 8`, the loop stops, and the function returns `number - 1 = 2`.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(√x)`. The loop runs until `number^2 > x`, so the time complexity depends on how many numbers we check before finding the answer, which is proportional to the square root of `x`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. The function only uses a few extra variables and does not require any additional space.

This approach is simple and works well for smaller values of `x`, but it can become inefficient for very large inputs since it checks each number one by one.

class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        left,right = 1, x
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if mid*mid == x:
                return mid
            if mid*mid>x:
                right=mid-1
            else:
                left=mid+1
        return right
