# Approach 1: BFS

- **Grid Dimensions**:
    
    - `rows = len(grid)` and `columns = len(grid[0])` give the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.
    - `result = 0` initializes the count of islands to zero.
- **BFS Function**:
    
    - **Queue Initialization**: A queue `q` is initialized with the starting land cell `(x, y)` where BFS begins.
    - **Processing Each Cell**:
        - The BFS loop continues as long as the queue is not empty.
        - `r, c = q.popleft()` retrieves the next cell to process (removing it from the queue).
        - The cell is processed only if it lies within the grid boundaries and is still land (`grid[r][c] == "1"`).
        - We mark it as visited (`grid[r][c] = "0"`) to prevent revisiting.
        - The neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) are added to the queue to explore next.
- **Main Logic**:
    
    - We loop through each cell in the grid.
    - When we find an unvisited land cell ('1'), we initiate a BFS starting from that cell, and after BFS finishes, we increment the `result` by 1.
    - This ensures we count each island once, even though it consists of many connected '1's.
- **Time Complexity**:
    
    - Each cell is visited once, so the time complexity is **O(m * n)** where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
- **Space Complexity**:
    
    - The space complexity is also **O(m * n)** in the worst case, as we might store all the land cells in the queue.

```python

class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        rows = len(grid)
        columns = len(grid[0])
        result = 0 
        
        def bfs(x,y):
            q = deque([(x,y)])
            while q:
                r, c = q.popleft()
                if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < columns and grid[r][c] == "1":
                     grid[r][c] = "0"
                     q.extend([(r - 1, c), (r + 1, c), (r, c - 1), (r, c + 1)])
            
        
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(columns):
                if grid[i][j] == "1":
                    bfs(i,j)
                    result += 1
        return result
        
```



# Approach 2: DFS


1. **Grid Dimensions and Initialization**:
    
    - `rows = len(grid)` and `columns = len(grid[0])` give the number of rows and columns in the grid.
    - `visited = [[False] * columns for _ in range(rows)]` creates a 2D array (`visited`) to track whether a cell has been visited. Initially, all values are `False`.
    - `result = 0` initializes the count of islands to zero.
2. **DFS Function**:
    
    - **Recursive DFS** replaces the BFS approach. Instead of using a queue, DFS recursively visits neighboring cells.
    - For each call of `dfs(x, y)`, it:
        - Checks if the cell `(x, y)` is within the grid bounds, is land (`grid[x][y] == "1"`), and hasn't been visited yet.
        - If all conditions are met, it marks the cell as visited (`visited[x][y] = True`).
        - It then recursively explores the neighboring cells in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
3. **Main Logic**:
    
    - The outer loop iterates over all the cells in the grid.
    - When an unvisited land cell (`"1"`) is found, the DFS starts from that cell to mark all connected land cells (i.e., the entire island) as visited.
    - Once the DFS completes, the island count (`result`) is incremented.

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Each cell is visited exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is also **O(m * n)**, accounting for the `visited` array and the recursion stack in the worst case where all cells are land.

```python

class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        rows = len(grid)
        columns = len(grid[0])
        result = 0 
        visited= [[False] * columns for _ in range(rows)]
        
        def dfs(x,y):
            # q = deque([(x,y)])
            # while q:
            #     r, c = q.popleft()
            #     if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < columns and grid[r][c] == "1" and not visited[r][c]:
            #          visited[r][c] = True
            #          q.extend([(r - 1, c), (r + 1, c), (r, c - 1), (r, c + 1)])
            if 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < columns and grid[x][y] == "1" and not visited[x][y]:
                visited[x][y] = True
                dfs(x-1,y)
                dfs(x+1,y)
                dfs(x,y-1)
                dfs(x,y+1)
            
        
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(columns):
                # if grid[i][j] == "1" and not visited[i][j]:
                #     bfs(i,j, visited)
                #     result += 1
                if grid[i][j] == "1" and not visited[i][j]:
                    dfs(i,j)
                    result+=1
        return result
        
```
