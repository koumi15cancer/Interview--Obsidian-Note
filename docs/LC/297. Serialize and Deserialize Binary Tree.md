### Problem Understanding

- **Serialize**: Convert the binary tree into a string representation.
- **Deserialize**: Convert the string back into the binary tree.

### Key Concept

Serialization involves converting the tree into a flat structure (string), and deserialization involves reconstructing the tree from the flat structure.

We can use a **preorder traversal** approach for both serialization and deserialization, where we visit nodes in the order of root-left-right.
# Approach 1:

#### 1. **Serialization**:

- Traverse the tree in preorder (root, left, right).
- Use `None` (or a specific marker like `"null"`) to represent missing nodes (leaves).
- Store node values as a string separated by commas.

#### 2. **Deserialization**:

- Read the serialized string and use recursion to reconstruct the tree.
- As we traverse the preorder string, construct the root first and then recursively build the left and right subtrees.


#### 1. **Serialization**:

- The `serialize` method is a recursive depth-first traversal (DFS) of the tree.
- For each node, we append the nodeâ€™s value to the result string and recursively serialize the left and right children.
- If a node is `None`, we append `"null"` to represent a null node.
- The final result is a string where values are separated by commas.

#### 2. **Deserialization**:

- The `deserialize` method converts the serialized string back into a tree structure.
- We split the string by commas to get a list of node values.
- Using an iterator over this list, we recursively build the tree in preorder (root, left, right). When we encounter `"null"`, we return `None`, indicating the absence of a node.


- **Time Complexity**:
    - Serialization: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit every node once.
    - Deserialization: **O(n)**, as we again process each node value exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**:
    - **O(n)** for both serialization and deserialization due to the recursive stack and the space needed to store the serialized string or node values.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Codec:
    
    def serialize(self, root: TreeNode) -> str:
        """Encodes a tree to a single string."""
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return "null"
            # Preorder traversal: root, left, right
            return f"{node.val},{dfs(node.left)},{dfs(node.right)}"
        
        # Call the helper DFS function
        return dfs(root)
    
    def deserialize(self, data: str) -> TreeNode:
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree."""
        def dfs(nodes):
            val = next(nodes)
            if val == "null":
                return None
            # Create node with the current value
            node = TreeNode(int(val))
            node.left = dfs(nodes)
            node.right = dfs(nodes)
            return node
        
        # Split the string by commas and start deserialization
        node_list = iter(data.split(','))
        return dfs(node_list)
