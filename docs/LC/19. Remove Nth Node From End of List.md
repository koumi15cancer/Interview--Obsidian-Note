# Approach 1: Two Pointer

- **Initialize Two Pointers**:
    
    - Use two pointers, `fast` and `slow`. Both pointers start at the beginning of the list.
- **Advance the Fast Pointer**:
    
    - Move the `fast` pointer nnn steps ahead. This way, the distance between `fast` and `slow` will be nnn.
- **Move Both Pointers Together**:
    
    - Move both `fast` and `slow` pointers one step at a time until `fast` reaches the end of the list. By then, `slow` will be right before the node that needs to be removed.
- **Remove the Node**:
    
    - Adjust the `next` pointer of the `slow` node to skip the node that needs to be removed.
- **Handle Edge Cases**:
    
    - If the list has only one node and you need to remove it, return `None`.
    - If `n` equals the length of the list, remove the head node.


```python

from typing import Optional

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Create a dummy node to handle edge cases easily
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        
        fast = slow = dummy
        
        # Move fast pointer n+1 steps ahead
        for _ in range(n + 1):
            fast = fast.next
        
        # Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
        while fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        # Remove the nth node from the end
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        
        # Return the new head
        return dummy.next
