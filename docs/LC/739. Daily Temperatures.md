# Approach 1:

- **Stack**: We use a stack to keep track of the indices of the temperatures that haven't yet found a warmer day.
    
    - Each time we encounter a warmer day, we pop the stack and calculate the difference in indices (i.e., how many days until a warmer temperature).
- **Result**: The `result` array is initialized with zeros since we only update the days when we find a warmer temperature.
    
- **Looping through temperatures**:
    
    - For each day, we compare the current temperature with the temperature at the index stored in the stack. If the current temperature is higher, it means we've found a warmer day for the previous day (the one stored in the stack).
    - We update the `result` for that previous day with the difference in indices (`i - prev_day`).
    - The current day is then added to the stack to potentially find its warmer day later.

```python

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = [0] * len(temperatures)
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(temperatures)):
            while stack and temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
                pre_day = stack.pop()
                result[pre_day] = i - pre_day
            stack.append(i)
        return result

```
