The problem involves breaking down the number into chunks (thousands, millions, billions) and converting each chunk into words. Here is the step-by-step approach:

#### Step 1: Predefined word mappings

- **Units:** Words for numbers 0 to 19.
- **Tens:** Words for tens like 20, 30, 40, ..., 90.
- **Thousands:** Words for the large number groups like "Thousand," "Million," and "Billion."

#### Step 2: Divide the number into parts

For large numbers, we divide the number into chunks of three digits, starting from the least significant digits (units, thousands, millions, billions). Each chunk is processed individually and converted into words.

#### Step 3: Process chunks

For each group of three digits, convert them to English words using the predefined mappings. If a chunk has hundreds, tens, and units, they are processed individually and combined. For example, 123 would be "One Hundred Twenty Three."

#### Step 4: Combine results

Once each chunk is converted to English words, combine them, adding the appropriate thousand, million, or billion suffix.


- **Helper function:**
    
    - Converts a number less than 1000 into words.
    - For numbers less than 20, use the `below_20` list.
    - For numbers between 20 and 99, use the `tens` list and recursively handle the remaining units.
    - For numbers between 100 and 999, process the hundreds part and the remaining two digits recursively.
- **Main logic:**
    
    - If `num` is zero, return `"Zero"`.
    - Use a loop to break the number into groups of 1000.
    - For each group, use the helper function to convert the number to words and append the appropriate "Thousand," "Million," or "Billion" suffix based on the group’s position.
- **Final combination:**
    
    - The results of each group are combined and trimmed for any extra spaces.


```python
class Solution:
    def numberToWords(self, num: int) -> str:
        # Helper function to convert a number less than 1000 to words
        def helper(n):
            if n == 0:
                return ''
            elif n < 20:
                return below_20[n] + ' '
            elif n < 100:
                return tens[n // 10] + ' ' + helper(n % 10)
            else:
                return below_20[n // 100] + ' Hundred ' + helper(n % 100)
        
        if num == 0:
            return "Zero"
        
        # Predefined words for numbers
        below_20 = ['Zero', 'One', 'Two', 'Three', 'Four', 'Five', 'Six', 'Seven', 'Eight', 'Nine', 'Ten', 
                    'Eleven', 'Twelve', 'Thirteen', 'Fourteen', 'Fifteen', 'Sixteen', 'Seventeen', 'Eighteen', 'Nineteen']
        tens = ['', '', 'Twenty', 'Thirty', 'Forty', 'Fifty', 'Sixty', 'Seventy', 'Eighty', 'Ninety']
        thousands = ['', 'Thousand', 'Million', 'Billion']
        
        result = ''
        i = 0  # To track the thousands index
        
        # Loop through the number in chunks of 1000
        while num > 0:
            if num % 1000 != 0:
                result = helper(num % 1000) + thousands[i] + ' ' + result
            num //= 1000
            i += 1
        
        # Return the final result after stripping any trailing spaces
        return result.strip()


```


### Dry Run

**Input:** `num = 12345`

1. Break the number into chunks:
    - 12 (thousands) and 345 (hundreds).
2. Process the 345:
    - 345 → "Three Hundred Forty Five"
3. Process the 12:
    - 12 → "Twelve"
4. Combine the results:
    - "Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"
5. Return the final result: `"Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"`

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of digits in the input number. For each chunk of digits (maximum 4 chunks for numbers up to a billion), the conversion takes constant time due to the small size of each group.
    
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` since we are not using any additional data structures that grow with input size (just a few lists and strings).
