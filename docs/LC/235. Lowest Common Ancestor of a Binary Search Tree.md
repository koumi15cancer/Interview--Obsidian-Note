1. **Base Case**: If `root` is `None`, return `None`. This happens if the tree is empty.
2. **Traverse Left Subtree**: If both `p.val` and `q.val` are smaller than `root.val`, both nodes lie in the left subtree, so we recursively call the function for `root.left`.
3. **Traverse Right Subtree**: If both `p.val` and `q.val` are greater than `root.val`, both nodes lie in the right subtree, so we recursively call the function for `root.right`.
4. **LCA Found**: If one of `p` or `q` is on the left side and the other is on the right (or one is the `root` itself), then the current `root` is the Lowest Common Ancestor.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(h)**: Where `h` is the height of the tree. In the worst case, this would be `O(n)` for a skewed tree, and `O(log n)` for a balanced tree.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(h)**: The space complexity is also dependent on the height `h` of the tree due to the recursion stack.

```python

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        # Base case: if the root is None, return None
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # If both p and q are smaller than root, explore the left subtree
        if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        
        # If both p and q are larger than root, explore the right subtree
        if p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        
        # If p and q are on different sides of root, return the current root as LCA
        return root
