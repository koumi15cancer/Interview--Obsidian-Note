# Approach 1: BFS


```python 

class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        rows, cols = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
        queue = deque()

        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if mat[i][j] == 0:
                    queue.append((i, j))
                else:
                    mat[i][j] = float('inf')

        while queue:
            row, col = queue.popleft()

            for dr, dc in directions:
                new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc

                if 0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols and mat[new_row][new_col] > mat[row][col] + 1:
                    mat[new_row][new_col] = mat[row][col] + 1
                    queue.append((new_row, new_col))

        return mat        
```


# Approach 2: DFS

1. **Initialization**:
    
    - We create a `distance` matrix initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`) to store the minimum distances to the nearest `0`.
2. **DFS Function**:
    
    - The recursive `dfs` function explores the neighbors of the current cell.
    - If the current cell is out of bounds, we return a large value (infinity).
    - If the current cell contains `0`, it returns `0` because the distance is zero.
    - Otherwise, the function checks whether we have already computed the distance for the current cell (to avoid redundant calculations).
    - Then, it recursively explores the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) and returns the smallest distance found plus one.
3. **DFS Call for Each `1`**:
    
    - For every `1` in the matrix, we call the `dfs` function to calculate the minimum distance to the nearest `0`.

### Efficiency:

- **Time Complexity**: Each call to `dfs` can potentially explore all cells in the matrix, resulting in a time complexity of **O((m * n) * 4)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because each cell may explore four directions.
    
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(m * n)** due to the recursion stack and the `distance` matrix.

```python

class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        rows = len(mat)
        cols = len(mat[0])
        distance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]  # Initialize with infinity

        # Helper function to perform DFS
        def dfs(r, c):
            # If out of bounds, return a large number (infinity)
            if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols:
                return float('inf')
            
            # If we hit a 0, the distance is 0
            if mat[r][c] == 0:
                return 0
            
            # If already visited and calculated, return the distance
            if distance[r][c] != float('inf'):
                return distance[r][c]
            
            # Explore neighbors (up, down, left, right) recursively
            up = dfs(r - 1, c) + 1
            down = dfs(r + 1, c) + 1
            left = dfs(r, c - 1) + 1
            right = dfs(r, c + 1) + 1

            # Take the minimum of all possible directions
            distance[r][c] = min(up, down, left, right)
            
            return distance[r][c]

        # Run DFS for each cell
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if mat[i][j] == 1:
                    dfs(i, j)  # For each 1, perform DFS to find the closest 0
        
        return distance
