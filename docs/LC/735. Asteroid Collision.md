# Approach 1: Stack

1. Initialize an empty list called `res` to store the final result.
    
2. Iterate through each element `a` in the `asteroids` list.
    
3. Check the current asteroid `a` and the last asteroid in the `res` list (if it exists) to determine whether there will be a collision or not.
    
4. The while loop `while res and a < 0 < res[-1]:` checks if the `res` list is not empty and if the current asteroid `a` is negative (moving left) while the last asteroid in `res` (`res[-1]`) is positive (moving right). This condition represents the potential for a collision.
    
5. If there's a potential collision, we need to resolve it:
    
    - If the magnitude of the current asteroid `a` is greater than the last asteroid's magnitude in `res` (`-a > res[-1]`), then the current asteroid will destroy the last asteroid in `res`. So, we pop the last asteroid from `res` using `res.pop()`.
        
    - If the magnitude of the current asteroid `a` is equal to the last asteroid's magnitude in `res` (`-a == res[-1]`), both asteroids will collide and destroy each other. So, we pop the last asteroid from `res` using `res.pop()`.
        
    - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means the current asteroid `a` will pass safely without any collision, and we break out of the while loop.
        
6. If the while loop finishes without encountering a collision, i.e., the current asteroid `a` is not destroyed by any other asteroid in `res`, we add the current asteroid `a` to the `res` list using `res.append(a)`.
    
7. Continue the iteration until all asteroids have been processed.
    
8. Finally, return the `res` list, which contains the asteroids that survived the collisions.
    

The algorithm efficiently handles asteroid collisions and returns the result with only the remaining asteroids after all collisions have been resolved.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(N)  
    N is the number of elements in the asteroids list. The for loop iterates through each asteroid once, and each iteration performs constant-time operations. The while loop inside the for loop can execute at most once per iteration. Overall, the code performs linear-time operations for each asteroid, resulting in a linear time complexity.
    
- Space complexity: O(N)  
    N is the number of elements in the asteroids list. The res list is the primary data structure that grows linearly with the number of asteroids. In the worst case, the res list will store all the asteroids if there are no collisions. So, the space complexity depends on the size of the input list asteroids.

```python

class Solution:
    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []

        for asteroid in asteroids:
            while stack and asteroid < 0 and stack[-1] > 0:
                if stack[-1] < -asteroid:
                    stack.pop()
                    continue
                elif stack[-1] == -asteroid:
                    stack.pop()
                break
            else:
                stack.append(asteroid)
        return stack
                
            

            
        
```
