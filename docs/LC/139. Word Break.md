# Approach 1: DP

1. **DP Array**:
    
    - `dp[i]` represents whether the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into words from the dictionary.
    - Initialize `dp[0]` as `True` because an empty substring can always be segmented.
2. **Word Dictionary as a Set**:
    
    - Convert `wordDict` to a set (`wordSet`) to make lookups faster.
3. **Iterating through the string**:
    
    - Loop through the string from position 1 to `n` (the length of `s`), trying to check for all possible substrings `s[j:i]` where `0 <= j < i`.
    - For each `i`, check if there exists a `j` where:
        1. `dp[j]` is `True` (i.e., the substring `s[0:j]` can be segmented).
        2. `s[j:i]` (the substring from `j` to `i`) exists in the dictionary (`wordSet`).
    - If both conditions are met, mark `dp[i]` as `True`, meaning that `s[0:i]` can be segmented.
4. **Final Result**:
    
    - At the end, return `dp[n]`, which tells whether the entire string `s` can be segmented into dictionary words.

### Example Walkthrough:

For `s = "leetcode"` and `wordDict = ["leet", "code"]`:

- The algorithm checks all substrings and sets `dp[i]` to `True` when valid segments are found:
    - `dp[4]` becomes `True` because `s[0:4] = "leet"` is in `wordDict`.
    - `dp[8]` becomes `True` because `s[4:8] = "code"` is in `wordDict`.

Thus, `dp[8]` is `True`, meaning `"leetcode"` can be segmented as `"leet"` + `"code"`

```PYTHON
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        dp = [False] * (n+1)
        dp[0] = True
        
        wordSet = set(wordDict)
        
        for i in range(1,n + 1):
            for j in range(i):
                if dp[j] == True and s[j:i] in wordSet:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break 
                    
        return dp[n]
                    
```


# Approach 2:

This solution uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** with **memoization** to solve the Word Break problem, which checks if the string `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words from `wordDict`.

1. **Memoization**:
    
    - A dictionary `memo` is used to store previously computed results for substrings. This helps avoid redundant computations and improves efficiency.
2. **Base Case**:
    
    - If the entire string `s` is already in `wordDict`, return `True` immediately.
    - If the substring `s` has been checked before (exists in `memo`), return the stored result to save time.
3. **Recursive DFS**:
    
    - The algorithm tries to break the string `s` into a `prefix` and the remaining part `s[i:]`.
    - For each possible `prefix` (from length 1 to `len(s)`), if the prefix exists in the word dictionary (`wordSet`), it recursively checks whether the remaining part `s[i:]` can also be broken down using the same logic.
4. **Memoization of Results**:
    
    - If a valid segmentation is found, store the result (`True`) in `memo` for future reference.
    - If no valid segmentation is found, store `False` in `memo`.
5. **Final Result**:
    
    - The recursive `dfs` call continues until either the string is successfully segmented or all possible segmentations are exhausted.

### Example Walkthrough:

For `s = "leetcode"` and `wordDict = ["leet", "code"]`:

- The algorithm tries different prefixes:
    - It finds `"leet"` is in `wordDict`, then recursively checks if `"code"` can be segmented.
    - Since `"code"` is also in the dictionary, it returns `True`.
- The result for `"leetcode"` is memoized as `True`.

This approach ensures that once a substring is computed, it doesn't need to be recomputed, making it more efficient.


```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        memo = {}
        wordSet = set(wordDict)
        return self.dfs(s, wordSet, memo)
    
    def dfs(self, s, wordSet, memo):
        if s in memo:
            return memo[s]
        if s in wordSet:
            return True
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            prefix = s[:i]
            if prefix in wordSet and self.dfs(s[i:], wordSet, memo):
                memo[s] = True
                return True
        memo[s] = False
        return False
