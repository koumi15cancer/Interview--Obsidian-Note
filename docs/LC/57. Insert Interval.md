# Approach 1:

- **Initialization**:
    
    - Get the length of the existing intervals: `length = len(intervals)`.
    - Extract the start and end of the new interval: `newStart, newEnd = newInterval[0], newInterval[1]`.
    - Initialize an empty result list: `result = []`.
    - Set the index `i` to zero to iterate through the existing intervals.
- **Add Non-Overlapping Intervals Before New Interval**:
    
    - The first `while` loop iterates through the existing intervals and appends any intervals that end before the new interval starts (`intervals[i][1] < newStart`) to the result list. This loop continues until it finds an overlapping interval.
- **Merge Overlapping Intervals**:
    
    - The second `while` loop checks for overlapping intervals by seeing if the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the new interval (`intervals[i][0] <= newEnd`).
    - If overlapping is detected, update `newStart` to the minimum of `newStart` and `intervals[i][0]`, and update `newEnd` to the maximum of `newEnd` and `intervals[i][1]`. This effectively merges the intervals.
    - Continue to increment the index `i`.
- **Add the Merged New Interval**:
    
    - After exiting the second loop, append the merged interval `[newStart, newEnd]` to the result list.
- **Add Remaining Non-Overlapping Intervals**:
    
    - The third `while` loop appends any remaining intervals that start after the merged new interval to the result list.
- **Return Result**:
    
    - Finally, return the result list, which contains the updated set of non-overlapping intervals.

### Dry Run Example

Letâ€™s consider an example where `intervals = [[1, 3], [6, 9]]` and `newInterval = [2, 5]`.

#### Initial Setup

plaintext

Copy code

`intervals = [[1, 3], [6, 9]] newInterval = [2, 5] newStart = 2 newEnd = 5 result = [] i = 0`

#### Step 1: Add Non-Overlapping Intervals Before New Interval

- **Iteration 1**:
    - Check `intervals[0] = [1, 3]`: since `3 < 2` is **false**, exit this loop.

Result after this step:

plaintext

Copy code

`result = []`

#### Step 2: Merge Overlapping Intervals

- **Iteration 2**:
    - Check `intervals[0] = [1, 3]`: since `1 <= 5` is **true**, we have an overlap.
    - Update `newStart = min(2, 1) = 1` and `newEnd = max(5, 3) = 5`.
    - Increment `i` to `1`.
- **Iteration 3**:
    - Check `intervals[1] = [6, 9]`: since `6 <= 5` is **false**, exit this loop.

Result after merging:

plaintext

Copy code

`result = [[1, 5]]  # Appending the merged interval`

#### Step 3: Add Remaining Non-Overlapping Intervals

- **Iteration 4**:
    - Check `intervals[1] = [6, 9]`: now add `[6, 9]` to the result since it starts after `newEnd`.
    - Increment `i` to `2`.

Final result after all steps:

plaintext

Copy code

`result = [[1, 5], [6, 9]]`
```python

class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        length = len(intervals)
        newStart,newEnd  = newInterval[0], newInterval[1]
        result = []
        i = 0 
        while i < length and intervals[i][1] < newStart:
            result.append(intervals[i])
            i+=1
        
        while i < length and intervals[i][0] <= newEnd:
            newStart = min(newStart, intervals[i][0])
            newEnd = max(newEnd, intervals[i][1])
            i += 1
        result.append([newStart, newEnd])
        
        # Add remaining intervals
        while i < len(intervals):
            result.append(intervals[i])
            i += 1
        
        return result   
        
```


# Approach 2:

- **Initialization**:
    
    - Define constants for easier access to the start and end points of intervals: `START, END = 0, 1`.
    - Extract the start and end of the new interval: `s, e = newInterval[START], newInterval[END]`.
    - Initialize two lists, `left` and `right`, to hold intervals that are on the left and right sides of the new interval.
- **Iterate Through Existing Intervals**:
    
    - Loop through each `cur_interval` in the `intervals` list:
        - **Left-hand Side Check**: If the current interval ends before the new interval starts (`cur_interval[END] < s`), it is added to the `left` list.
        - **Right-hand Side Check**: If the current interval starts after the new interval ends (`cur_interval[START] > e`), it is added to the `right` list.
        - **Overlap Check**: If the current interval overlaps with the new interval, merge them by updating the boundaries:
            - Update the start of the new interval to the minimum of `s` and `cur_interval[START]`.
            - Update the end of the new interval to the maximum of `e` and `cur_interval[END]`.
- **Construct the Result**:
    
    - Combine the three parts: the `left` intervals, the merged new interval `[s, e]`, and the `right` intervals.
    - Return this combined list.

```python

class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals, newInterval):
        
        # Constant to help us access start point and end point of interval
        START, END = 0, 1
        
        s, e = newInterval[START], newInterval[END]
        
        left, right = [], []
        
        for cur_interval in intervals:
            
            if cur_interval[END] < s:
                # current interval is on the left-hand side of newInterval
                left += [ cur_interval ]
                
            elif cur_interval[START] > e:
                # current interval is on the right-hand side of newInterval
                right += [ cur_interval ]
                
            else:
                # current interval has overlap with newInterval
                # merge and update boundary
                s = min(s, cur_interval[START])
                e = max(e, cur_interval[END])
                
        return left + [ [s, e] ] + right
