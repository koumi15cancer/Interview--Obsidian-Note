Approach 1: Brute Force
Pseudocode:
- Flatten matrix to list 1D
- Iterate and add value from matrix to new list store
- Sort 1D list ascending order
- return value at index k - 1

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        # flatter to array
        store = []

        # Iterate through row & col of matrix
        for row in range(len(matrix)):
            for col in range(len(matrix)):
                store.append(matrix[row][col])
            
        # Sort list storage in ascending order
        store.sort()

        return store[k - 1]
        

```


Approach 2:  Using min heap

```python


class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        rowCount = len(matrix)
        min_heap = []

        # Push the first element of each row into the minHeap
        for i in range(min(rowCount, k)):
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (matrix[i][0], i, 0))

        numbers_checked = 0
        smallest_element = 0

        while min_heap:
            # Get the smallest element from the heap
            smallest_element, row_index, col_index = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            numbers_checked += 1

            # If we've checked k elements, return the k-th smallest element
            if numbers_checked == k:
                break

            # If there is a next element in the current row, add it to the heap
            if col_index + 1 < len(matrix[row_index]):
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (matrix[row_index][col_index + 1], row_index, col_index + 1))

        return smallest_element
```

Approach 3: Binary search on range value 

Pseudocode:
1. Set `low` to the smallest element in the matrix.
2. Set `high` to the largest element in the matrix.
3. While `low` is less than `high`:
    - Compute the `mid` value.
    - Count how many elements in the matrix are less than or equal to `mid`.
    - If the count is less than `k`, set `low` to `mid + 1`.
    - Otherwise, set `high` to `mid`.
4. Return `low` as the kth smallest element.

#### Time Complexity:

- **O(n * log(max - min))**:
    - `n` for iterating over the matrix to count elements less than or equal to `mid` (using the `countLessEqual` function).
    - The `log(max - min)` comes from the binary search over the value range of elements in the matrix.

#### Space Complexity:

- **O(1)**: Constant extra space is used, as we only keep track of pointers (`low`, `high`, and `mid`).

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(matrix)
        
        def countLessEqual(mid):
            count, row, col = 0, n - 1, 0
            while row >= 0 and col < n:
                if matrix[row][col] <= mid:
                    count += row + 1
                    col += 1
                else:
                    row -= 1
            return count

        low, high = matrix[0][0], matrix[-1][-1]
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if countLessEqual(mid) < k:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low

```

Approach 4: Binary Search with Row-Wise Pointers
#### Pseudo-code:

1. Set `low` to the smallest element in the matrix.
2. Set `high` to the largest element in the matrix.
3. While `low` is less than `high`:
    - Compute the `mid` value.
    - For each row, count how many elements are less than or equal to `mid` using binary search (`bisect_right`).
    - If the count is less than `k`, set `low` to `mid + 1`.
    - Otherwise, set `high` to `mid`.
4. Return `low` as the kth smallest element.

#### Time Complexity:

- **O(n * log n + n * log(max - min))**:
    - `n \* log n` comes from using binary search (`bisect_right`) to count elements in each row.
    - `log(max - min)` comes from the binary search over the value range of matrix elements.

#### Space Complexity:

- **O(1)**: Constant space is used aside from the input matrix, no extra data structures are required.

### Explanation of `bisect.bisect_right`:

- `bisect_right(arr, x)` is a function from Python's `bisect` module that performs a **binary search** on a sorted list `arr` to find the insertion point of `x` such that all elements to the left are less than or equal to `x`.
- It returns the **index** where you could insert `x` in a sorted list while keeping it in sorted order. All elements at or to the left of this index are less than or equal to `x`.

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(matrix)
        
        def countLessEqual(mid):
            count = 0
            for i in range(n):
                count += bisect.bisect_right(matrix[i], mid)
            return count

        low, high = matrix[0][0], matrix[-1][-1]
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if countLessEqual(mid) < k:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low


```

Approach 5 :Matrix Decomposition (Divide & Conquer)

1. Set `low` to the smallest element in the matrix.
2. Set `high` to the largest element in the matrix.
3. While `low` is less than `high`:
    - Compute the `mid` value.
    - Count how many elements in the matrix are less than or equal to `mid`.
    - If the count is less than `k`, set `low` to `mid + 1`.
    - Otherwise, set `high` to `mid`.
4. Return `low` as the kth smallest element.

#### Time Complexity:

- **O(n * log(max - min))**: Same as the binary search on value range.

#### Space Complexity:

- **O(1)**: Constant space is used.

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(matrix)
        
        def countLessEqual(mid):
            count, row, col = 0, n - 1, 0
            while row >= 0 and col < n:
                if matrix[row][col] <= mid:
                    count += row + 1
                    col += 1
                else:
                    row -= 1
            return count

        low, high = matrix[0][0], matrix[-1][-1]
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if countLessEqual(mid) < k:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low


```

Approach 6 :Two Pointers Approach (Row-wise Traversal)

#### Pseudo-code:

1. Flatten the matrix into a 1D array.
2. Sort the flattened array.
3. Return the `k-1` element of the sorted array (since it is 0-indexed).

#### Time Complexity:

- **O(n² * log(n²))**: Flattening the matrix takes `O(n²)`, and sorting it takes `O(n² \* log(n²))`.

#### Space Complexity:

- **O(n²)**: The flattened matrix requires space for `n²` elements.

```python

class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(matrix)
        flat_list = []
        
        # Flatten the matrix
        for row in matrix:
            flat_list.extend(row)
        
        # Sort the flattened list
        flat_list.sort()
        
        # Return the k-th smallest element (1-indexed, hence k-1)
        return flat_list[k-1]


```
