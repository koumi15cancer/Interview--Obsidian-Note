- **Create a Dummy Node**: This node helps in easily returning the merged list later without special handling of the head node.
    
- **Initialize Pointers**:
    
    - `current`: A pointer to keep track of the end of the merged list.
    - `l1` and `l2`: Pointers to traverse `list1` and `list2` respectively.
- **Merge Lists**:
    
    - Compare the values of the nodes pointed to by `l1` and `l2`.
    - Append the smaller node to `current.next` and advance the corresponding pointer (`l1` or `l2`).
    - Move `current` to `current.next`.
- **Handle Remaining Nodes**:
    
    - After one of the lists is exhausted, append the remaining nodes of the other list to the end of the merged list.
- **Return the Merged List**:
    
    - The merged list starts from `dummy.next`, as `dummy` was a placeholder node.
