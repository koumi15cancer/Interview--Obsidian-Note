# Approach 1:

- **Area of the Two Rectangles**:
    
    - The area of the first rectangle is `(C - A) * (D - B)` where `(A, B)` are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner and `(C, D)` are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
    - Similarly, the area of the second rectangle is `(G - E) * (H - F)` where `(E, F)` and `(G, H)` represent the corners of the second rectangle.
- **Calculate the Overlapping Area**:
    
    - The two rectangles might overlap. To calculate the overlapping area, you need to find the overlapping width and height.
    - The overlapping width is determined by:
        - `max(0, min(C, G) - max(A, E))`: This calculates the overlap along the x-axis. If `min(C, G) > max(A, E)`, then there is overlap; otherwise, the result will be zero.
    - The overlapping height is determined by:
        - `max(0, min(D, H) - max(B, F))`: This calculates the overlap along the y-axis. If `min(D, H) > max(B, F)`, then there is overlap; otherwise, the result will be zero.
    - The overlapping area is the product of the overlapping width and height.
- **Calculate the Total Area**:
    
    - The total area is the sum of the areas of both rectangles minus the overlapping area (if any overlap exists).

    def computeArea(self, ax1: int, ay1: int, ax2: int, ay2: int, bx1: int, by1: int, bx2: int, by2: int) -> int:
        # Calculate the area of the two rectangles
        area1 = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1)
        area2 = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1)
        
        # Calculate the overlapping width
        overlap_width = max(0, min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1))
        
        # Calculate the overlapping height
        overlap_height = max(0, min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1))
        
        # Calculate the overlapping area
        overlap_area = overlap_width * overlap_height
        
        # Total area is the sum of both areas minus the overlapping area
        total_area = area1 + area2 - overlap_area
        
        return total_area
