Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

# Approach 1:

The most efficient approach to reverse bits is to use bit manipulation. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialize a Result Variable**: Start with a result variable set to zero. This variable will store the reversed bits.
    
2. **Iterate Through Each Bit**: Loop 32 times (for each bit in a 32-bit integer):
    
    - **Shift the Result Left**: Shift the result left by one position to make space for the next bit.
    - **Get the Rightmost Bit of n**: Use a bitwise AND operation (`n & 1`) to extract the rightmost bit of `n`.
    - **Add the Bit to the Result**: Add the extracted bit to the result using a bitwise OR operation.
    - **Shift n Right**: Shift `n` right by one position to process the next bit in the next iteration.
3. **Return the Result**: After the loop, the result will contain the reversed bits


```python

class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        for i in range(32):
            result <<= 1                # Shift result left
            result |= (n & 1)           # Add the last bit of n
            n >>= 1                    # Shift n right to process the next bit
        return result
