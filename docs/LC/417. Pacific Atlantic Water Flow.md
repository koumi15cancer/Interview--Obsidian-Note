The problem is about determining which cells in a given grid (representing an island) allow water to flow to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

### Problem Breakdown:

#### 1. **Island Layout**:

- The island is represented as a **matrix (grid)** of dimensions **m x n**.
- Each cell has a height (`heights[r][c]`) that represents the elevation above sea level at that point.
- The **Pacific Ocean** borders the **left and top** edges of the grid.
- The **Atlantic Ocean** borders the **right and bottom** edges of the grid.

#### 2. **Water Flow**:

- Water can flow from a cell to another neighboring cell **only if** the neighboring cell’s height is **less than or equal to** the current cell’s height. This means water flows from high to low or equal elevation.
- Water can also flow from a cell directly to the ocean if it is adjacent to an edge that touches an ocean.

#### 3. **Objective**:

You need to find out which cells allow rainwater to flow to **both** the **Pacific** and **Atlantic** oceans. The goal is to return a list of coordinates `[ri, ci]` where water can flow to **both oceans**.

### Key Points:

1. **What does water flowing to both oceans mean?**
    
    - For a cell to be able to flow to both the **Pacific** and **Atlantic**, the water from that cell should be able to travel:
        - To the **Pacific** through neighboring cells, flowing towards the **left or top** edges.
        - To the **Atlantic** through neighboring cells, flowing towards the **right or bottom** edges.
2. **What does it mean that water can only flow downhill or stay at the same height?**
    
    - If a cell has water and wants to flow to the neighboring cell, the neighboring cell must be **lower or the same height**. This means the water can't go from a lower height to a higher height.
3. **How does water flow start?**
    
    - Water starts from the **edges** of the grid:
        - From the **top and left** for the Pacific.
        - From the **bottom and right** for the Atlantic.
    - The water spreads out to neighboring cells if those cells are lower or equal in height.
4. **What are we returning?**
    
    - The result will be a list of **coordinates** where rainwater can flow to **both** oceans, meaning these cells can eventually reach both the **Pacific** and the **Atlantic**.

### Example:

Consider a simple 3x3 grid:

lua

Copy code

`heights = [[1, 2, 2],            [3, 2, 3],            [2, 4, 5]]`

- The **Pacific** is on the **top and left** borders of the grid.
- The **Atlantic** is on the **right and bottom** borders of the grid.

### Flow Example:

- Cell (0, 0) has height 1. It can flow directly into the Pacific (since it's on the top edge), but it cannot reach the Atlantic since water can't go upwards to higher cells like (1, 0) which is height 3.
- Cell (2, 2) has height 5. It can flow to the Atlantic directly (bottom edge) and also to the Pacific, since water can flow from higher cells to lower cells towards the top-left corner.
- We need to find **all** such cells that can connect to **both** oceans.

### Strategy to Solve:

- Use a **graph traversal** approach (like DFS or BFS) starting from the Pacific and Atlantic edges separately.
    - First, find all cells that can flow to the **Pacific**.
    - Then, find all cells that can flow to the **Atlantic**.
    - The **intersection** of these two sets of cells will give the result — the cells where water can flow to **both** oceans.
