The problem is about determining which cells in a given grid (representing an island) allow water to flow to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

### Problem Breakdown:

#### 1. **Island Layout**:

- The island is represented as a **matrix (grid)** of dimensions **m x n**.
- Each cell has a height (`heights[r][c]`) that represents the elevation above sea level at that point.
- The **Pacific Ocean** borders the **left and top** edges of the grid.
- The **Atlantic Ocean** borders the **right and bottom** edges of the grid.

#### 2. **Water Flow**:

- Water can flow from a cell to another neighboring cell **only if** the neighboring cell’s height is **less than or equal to** the current cell’s height. This means water flows from high to low or equal elevation.
- Water can also flow from a cell directly to the ocean if it is adjacent to an edge that touches an ocean.

#### 3. **Objective**:

You need to find out which cells allow rainwater to flow to **both** the **Pacific** and **Atlantic** oceans. The goal is to return a list of coordinates `[ri, ci]` where water can flow to **both oceans**.

### Key Points:

1. **What does water flowing to both oceans mean?**
    
    - For a cell to be able to flow to both the **Pacific** and **Atlantic**, the water from that cell should be able to travel:
        - To the **Pacific** through neighboring cells, flowing towards the **left or top** edges.
        - To the **Atlantic** through neighboring cells, flowing towards the **right or bottom** edges.
2. **What does it mean that water can only flow downhill or stay at the same height?**
    
    - If a cell has water and wants to flow to the neighboring cell, the neighboring cell must be **lower or the same height**. This means the water can't go from a lower height to a higher height.
3. **How does water flow start?**
    
    - Water starts from the **edges** of the grid:
        - From the **top and left** for the Pacific.
        - From the **bottom and right** for the Atlantic.
    - The water spreads out to neighboring cells if those cells are lower or equal in height.
4. **What are we returning?**
    
    - The result will be a list of **coordinates** where rainwater can flow to **both** oceans, meaning these cells can eventually reach both the **Pacific** and the **Atlantic**.

### Example:

Consider a simple 3x3 grid:

lua

Copy code

`heights = [[1, 2, 2],            [3, 2, 3],            [2, 4, 5]]`

- The **Pacific** is on the **top and left** borders of the grid.
- The **Atlantic** is on the **right and bottom** borders of the grid.

### Flow Example:

- Cell (0, 0) has height 1. It can flow directly into the Pacific (since it's on the top edge), but it cannot reach the Atlantic since water can't go upwards to higher cells like (1, 0) which is height 3.
- Cell (2, 2) has height 5. It can flow to the Atlantic directly (bottom edge) and also to the Pacific, since water can flow from higher cells to lower cells towards the top-left corner.
- We need to find **all** such cells that can connect to **both** oceans.

### Strategy to Solve:

- Use a **graph traversal** approach (like DFS or BFS) starting from the Pacific and Atlantic edges separately.
    - First, find all cells that can flow to the **Pacific**.
    - Then, find all cells that can flow to the **Atlantic**.
    - The **intersection** of these two sets of cells will give the result — the cells where water can flow to **both** oceans.

# Approach 1: BFS

1. **Grid Initialization**:
    
    - `rows` and `cols` store the dimensions of the grid.
    - The `directions` array represents the 4 possible moves: up, down, left, right.
2. **BFS Function**:
    
    - The `bfs` function is responsible for performing the breadth-first search from a list of starting cells (either the Pacific or Atlantic edges).
    - `visited` is a set used to keep track of the cells that have been reached.
    - Starting from the cells on the edges (Pacific or Atlantic), the BFS explores neighboring cells and checks if their height is greater than or equal to the current cell's height. If so, it adds them to the queue and continues the exploration.
3. **Pacific and Atlantic Starting Points**:
    
    - `pacific_starts` initializes the starting points for the Pacific Ocean, which are the cells on the **top row** and **left column**.
    - `atlantic_starts` initializes the starting points for the Atlantic Ocean, which are the cells on the **bottom row** and **right column**.
4. **BFS Execution**:
    
    - The BFS is performed twice: once from the Pacific edge cells (`pacific_starts`) and once from the Atlantic edge cells (`atlantic_starts`).
    - The reachable cells from both oceans are stored in `pacific_reachable` and `atlantic_reachable`.
5. **Intersection of Results**:
    
    - The final result is the **intersection** of the sets of cells that are reachable from both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. This is done using `pacific_reachable & atlantic_reachable`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. We visit each cell in the grid at most twice (once for each BFS).
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), due to the space used by the `visited` set and the queue for BFS.




```python

from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def pacificAtlantic(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not heights or not heights[0]:
            return []

        rows, cols = len(heights), len(heights[0])
        
        # Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
        
        # BFS helper function
        def bfs(starts):
            visited = set(starts)
            q = deque(starts)
            
            while q:
                r, c = q.popleft()
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    new_r, new_c = r + dr, c + dc
                    # Check if new cell is within bounds and higher or equal to current cell
                    if 0 <= new_r < rows and 0 <= new_c < cols and (new_r, new_c) not in visited and heights[new_r][new_c] >= heights[r][c]:
                        q.append((new_r, new_c))
                        visited.add((new_r, new_c))
            return visited

        # Start BFS from the Pacific ocean's edges (top row and left column)
        pacific_starts = [(r, 0) for r in range(rows)] + [(0, c) for c in range(cols)]
        # Start BFS from the Atlantic ocean's edges (bottom row and right column)
        atlantic_starts = [(r, cols - 1) for r in range(rows)] + [(rows - 1, c) for c in range(cols)]

        # Perform BFS for both oceans
        pacific_reachable = bfs(pacific_starts)
        atlantic_reachable = bfs(atlantic_starts)

        # The result is the intersection of cells reachable from both oceans
        return list(pacific_reachable & atlantic_reachable)

```

# Approach 2: DFS

1. **Grid Initialization**:
    
    - `rows` and `cols` store the dimensions of the grid.
    - `directions` is an array representing the 4 possible moves: up, down, left, and right.
2. **DFS Helper Function**:
    
    - The `dfs` function is responsible for performing the depth-first search.
    - It takes the current cell `(r, c)` and explores all its neighbors. If a neighbor cell is within bounds, hasn't been visited yet, and its height is greater than or equal to the current cell's height, DFS proceeds to that neighbor.
    - Each cell is added to the `visited` set to ensure that it is not processed multiple times.
3. **Pacific and Atlantic Starting Points**:
    
    - The DFS is started from the edges of the grid:
        - For the **Pacific Ocean**, the starting points are the cells on the **top row** and **left column**.
        - For the **Atlantic Ocean**, the starting points are the cells on the **bottom row** and **right column**.
4. **Perform DFS**:
    
    - DFS is performed from each edge of the grid:
        - For the **Pacific Ocean**, DFS is performed from all cells on the top and left edges.
        - For the **Atlantic Ocean**, DFS is performed from all cells on the bottom and right edges.
5. **Intersection of Results**:
    
    - After both DFS traversals, we check each cell in the grid. If a cell is present in both the `pacific_visited` and `atlantic_visited` sets, it means the cell can flow to both oceans. These cells are added to the result list.
6. **Return the Result**:
    
    - Finally, we return the list of cells that can flow to both oceans.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. Every cell is visited once during the DFS.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), due to the space used for the `visited` sets and the recursion stack in DFS.

        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

        def dfs(r, c, visited):
            # Mark the current cell as visited
            visited.add((r, c))
            
            # Explore all 4 directions
            for dr, dc in directions:
                new_r, new_c = r + dr, c + dc
                
                # Check if the new cell is within bounds and if it hasn't been visited yet,
                # and if its height is greater than or equal to the current cell's height
                if 0 <= new_r < rows and 0 <= new_c < cols and (new_r, new_c) not in visited and heights[new_r][new_c] >= heights[r][c]:
                    dfs(new_r, new_c, visited)
        
        # Initialize sets to store visited cells for both oceans
        pacific_visited = set()
        atlantic_visited = set()
        
        # Perform DFS from the Pacific Ocean's edges (top row and left column)
        for i in range(rows):
            dfs(i, 0, pacific_visited)  # Left column (Pacific)
            dfs(i, cols - 1, atlantic_visited)  # Right column (Atlantic)
        
        for j in range(cols):
            dfs(0, j, pacific_visited)  # Top row (Pacific)
            dfs(rows - 1, j, atlantic_visited)  # Bottom row (Atlantic)
        
        # Find cells that can flow to both oceans (intersection of two visited sets)
        result = []
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if (r, c) in pacific_visited and (r, c) in atlantic_visited:
                    result.append([r, c])
        
        return result
