1. **Find the Middle of the List**:
    
    - Use the slow and fast pointer technique to locate the middle of the linked list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
2. **Split the List**:
    
    - Split the list into two halves at the middle point. The first half will end where the middle node was found, and the second half will start from the node after the middle node.
3. **Reverse the Second Half**:
    
    - Reverse the second half of the list to facilitate the reordering process. This helps in merging the nodes from the two halves in the desired order.
4. **Merge the Two Halves**:
    
    - Alternately merge nodes from the first half and the reversed second half.


```python

from typing import Optional

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        if not head or not head.next or not head.next.next:
            return
        
        # Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # Step 2: Split the list into two halves
        second = slow.next
        slow.next = None
        first = head
        
        # Step 3: Reverse the second half
        prev, curr = None, second
        while curr:
            next_node = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next_node
        second = prev
        
        # Step 4: Merge the two halves
        while second:
            temp1, temp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = temp1
            first, second = temp1, temp2


```


### Explanation

1. **Finding the Middle**:
    
    - The `slow` and `fast` pointers are used to find the middle of the list. By the time `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the middle.
2. **Splitting the List**:
    
    - After locating the middle, split the list into two halves. The first half starts from `head` to `slow`, and the second half starts from `slow.next`.
3. **Reversing the Second Half**:
    
    - Reverse the second half of the list to prepare it for merging. The reversed list helps in reordering nodes as required.
4. **Merging the Two Halves**:
    
    - Merge the nodes from the first half and the reversed second half alternately.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. Each node is visited a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The reordering is done in-place with no additional space required except for a few pointers.
