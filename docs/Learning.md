# **Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory**

1. **Concrete Experience (CE)**: This is the first stage, where the learner actively experiences an activity such as a lab session or fieldwork. For example, you started to learn a new programming language, such as syntax, structure, commands, etc. Then, you wrote a few simple programs and ran into a few errors you didn’t understand.
    
2. **Reflective Observation (RO)**: After the concrete experience, the learner reflects on the occasion. This reflection can take many forms, from a simple pause to consider what happened to a more structured debriefing. For example, after writing and running your first few programs, you take a step back and reflect on the experience. You think about what went well and what didn't. You may also read other people's code comparing it to yours.
    
3. **Abstract Conceptualization (AC)**: In this stage, the learner makes sense of what happened during the experience by considering their reflections and forming abstract concepts and generalizations. You realize that the programming language has a particular style and idioms that are different from other languages you know. You understand its unique features, like indentation for code blocks, dynamic typing, and robust data structures like lists and dictionaries.
    
4. **Active Experimentation (AE)**: The final stage involves applying the concepts learned in the abstract conceptualization stage to new situations. This leads to new experiences, and the cycle begins anew. For example, with your newfound understanding of a new programming language, you start experimenting. First, you write more complex programs using your knowledge of the language’s unique features. Then, you try to solve more complicated problems.

Kolb’s experiential learning cycle

According to Kolb, effective learning occurs when a person can complete all four-cycle stages. However, people may prefer different stages of the cycle, and this preference then leads to various learning styles:

- **Converging (AC/AE)**: These learners are good at applying ideas and solving problems. They prefer technical tasks and are less interested in interpersonal aspects, e.g., diving into docs and systematically learning about them.
    
- **Diverging (CE/RO)**: These learners are good at brainstorming and generating ideas. They have broad interests and like to gather information, such as by exploring different libraries and frameworks.
    
- **Assimilating (AC/RO)**: These learners are good at understanding a wide range of information and organizing it in a clear, logical format. They are more interested in abstract concepts than people. They like to read books or take courses on a programming language and a structured approach to learning.
    
- **Accommodating (CE/AE)**: These learners are good at implementing plans and involving themselves in new experiences. They tend to rely on others for information and prefer a practical approach. They would jump right into a project or problem as they learn a new programming language and like to do, e.g., pair programming.
    

The theory posits that learning is a process that involves a balance between these four modes and that the learner can start at any stage but must go through each in sequence for successful learning to occur.

## Remembering what you read with note-taking

People often ask me **what my superpowers are**. And my answer is only one: **I tend to write things down.** Anything we hear or learn in a few days or months will disappear and only suffice if we don't take notes. As David Allen said, "_Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them_."

I take notes, a lot of notes. I used different note-taking methods over the years, and here I want to present one effective one, called **the Cornell method**.

The Cornell Method of note-taking was devised by Dr. Walter Pauk, an education professor at Cornell University, during the 1940s. Dr. Pauk designed this system to enable students to articulate and apply the concepts they learned efficiently.

How you can use this method:

1. **Prepare your page**. Divide a sheet of paper into three sections: a narrow left-hand column called the "Cue Column," a wider right-hand column for "Note-taking," and a small section at the bottom for a "Summary."
    
2. **Engage in Note-taking.** Use the Note-taking column to jot down main ideas, details, and diagrams during a lecture or reading. Aim for phrases over complete sentences to keep things brief.
    
3. **Craft Cues.** Post-session, glance through your notes, crafting questions or keywords relating to the material in the Cue Column. This sets the stage for active review.
    
4. **Reflect.** Cover the Note-taking column, using your cues to recite the material. This helps in embedding the information in your memory. Also, please take a moment to reflect on the material, relating it to what you already know.
    
5. **Summarize** - In the Summary section, encapsulate the critical points of the page's material in your own words. This reinforces understanding and prepares you for future reviews.
    

Also, remember to **do periodic reviews** using the Cue column, and your Summary will help reinforce the material over time.
